<h3 title="Some Press Opinions"><i>SOME PRESS OPINIONS.</i></h3>
<hr class="small" >

<div class="smalltext">
<p>“This is probably one of the most important cookery books issued this century,
and will, it may be presumed, eventually take its place alongside the familiar
culinary classics of former days. It is especially interesting as marking the
inauguration of an entirely new style of living. M. Escoffier’s book is a culinary
education in itself, and should take rank as a standard, be studied by all housekeepers
who have either large households or gourmets to cater for, and should most
certainly be placed in the hands of all persons training for high-class cookery
teachers.”—<i>Queen.</i></p>

<p>“His book is comprehensive. It begins at the beginning and explains the
principles, so that a lady who reads it may talk learnedly to her cook; it deals fully
with all the old-established dishes of different countries; but its main feature is the
number of delightful novelties which it introduces to notice. There are plenty of
recipes which may be applied with advantage in the middle-class household where
the lady in the kitchen has nobody under her, for M. Escoffier’s directions deal alike
with humble and elaborate preparations.”—<i>Outlook.</i></p>

<p>“It is a big book written by a great cook, and it will be useful not only to accomplished
cooks and experienced housekeepers, but also to beginners in the kitchen and
the housekeeper’s room, for M. Escoffier takes nothing for granted and explains very
patiently all the groundwork of the art of cookery before he discussed the <i>haute
cuisine</i>. It contains much that is interesting to the <i>gourmet</i> as well as much that is
useful to the cook, for he has little tales to tell concerning some of the dishes; and
now and again a scrap of history crops up.”—<i>Tatler.</i></p>

<p>“Even as you take up the volume a sense of pleasurable anticipation takes
possession of you, so pleasing is the cover, so clear and bold is the type, and so
delightful to the touch is the paper on which is printed the garnered wisdom of the
famous <i>chef</i>. A little reading will soon show you that it is as full of sound wisdom,
and of fresh and interesting information, as Brillat-Savarin’s “Physiologie du
Goût”<!-- TN: closing quote inserted -->.”—<i>The Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“The ordinary good plain British cook will discover something worth the learning
on every page; the worried mistresses of small establishments will cherish the book as
a treasure-house of new ideas; the man who likes a good dinner but has no special
knowledge of the art of the kitchen will find the preface and the introductions to the
chapters capital reading; and every English-speaking gourmet will have a well
thumbed copy of this very modern “Guide” upon his book-shelf. The book is a
comprehensive one, and at the same time a simple one. It is a book that should be
in every house.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p><span class="smc">If</span> the art of Cookery in all its branches were not undergoing
a process of evolution, and if its canons could be once
and for ever fixed, as are those of certain scientific operations
and mathematical procedures, the present work would have no
<i>raison d’être</i>; inasmuch as there already exist several excellent
culinary text-books in the English language. But everything
is so unstable in these times of progress at any cost, and social
customs and methods of life alter so rapidly, that a few years
now suffice to change completely the face of usages which at
their inception bade fair to outlive the age—so enthusiastically
were they welcomed by the public.</p>

<p>In regard to the traditions of the festal board, it is but
twenty years ago since the ancestral English customs began to
make way before the newer methods, and we must look to the
great impetus given to travelling by steam traction and navigation,
in order to account for the gradual but unquestionable
revolution.</p>

<p>In the wake of the demand came the supply. Palatial hotels
were built, sumptuous restaurants were opened, both of which
offered their customers luxuries undreamt of theretofore in such
establishments.</p>

<p>Modern society contracted the habit of partaking of light
suppers in these places, after the theatres of the Metropolis
had closed; and the well-to-do began to flock to them on
Sundays, in order to give their servants the required weekly
rest. And, since restaurants allow of observing and of being
observed, since they are eminently adapted to the exhibiting of
magnificent dresses, it was not long before they entered into
the life of Fortune’s favourites.</p>

<p>But these new-fangled habits had to be met by novel methods
of Cookery—better adapted to the particular environment in
which they were to be practised. The admirable productions
popularised by the old Masters of the Culinary Art of the
<a id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>vi<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>preceding Century did not become the light and more frivolous
atmosphere of restaurants; were, in fact, ill-suited to the brisk
waiters, and their customers who only had eyes for one another.</p>

<p>The pompous splendour of those bygone dinners, served in
the majestic dining-halls of Manors and Palaces, by liveried
footmen, was part and parcel of the etiquette of Courts and
lordly mansions.</p>

<p>It is eminently suited to State dinners, which are in sooth
veritable ceremonies, possessing their ritual, traditions, and—one
might even say—their high priests; but it is a mere hindrance
to the modern, rapid service. The complicated and
sometimes heavy menus would be unwelcome to the hypercritical
appetites so common nowadays; hence the need of a
radical change not only in the culinary preparations themselves,
but in the arrangements of the menus, and the service.</p>

<p>Circumstances ordained that I should be one of the movers
in this revolution, and that I should manage the kitchens of
two establishments which have done most to bring it about.
I therefore venture to suppose that a book containing a record
of all the changes which have come into being in kitchen work—changes
whereof I am in a great part author—may have some
chance of a good reception at the hands of the public, <i>i.e.</i>, at
the hands of those very members of it who have profited by
the changes I refer to.</p>

<p>For it was only with the view of meeting the many and
persistent demands for such a record that the present volume
was written.</p>

<p>I had at first contemplated the possibility of including only
new recipes in this formulary. But it should be borne in mind
that the changes that have transformed kitchen procedure during
the last twenty-five years could not all be classed under the head
of new recipes; for, apart from the fundamental principles of
the science, which we owe to Carême, and which will last as
long as Cooking itself, scarcely one old-fashioned method has
escaped the necessary new moulding required by modern
demands. For fear of giving my work an incomplete appearance,
therefore, I had to refer to these old-fashioned practices
and to include among my new recipes those of the former
which most deserved to survive. But it should not be forgotten
that in a few years, judging from the rate at which things are
going, the publication of a fresh selection of recipes may become
necessary; I hope to live long enough to see this accomplished,
in order that I may follow the evolution, started in my time,
and add a few more original creations to those I have already
<a id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>-9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had the pleasure of seeing adopted; despite the fact that the
discovery of new dishes grows daily more difficult.</p>

<p>But novelty is the universal cry—novelty by hook or by
crook! It is an exceedingly common mania among people of
inordinate wealth to exact incessantly new or so-called new
dishes. Sometimes the demand comes from a host whose luxurious
table has exhausted all the resources of the modern cook’s
repertory, and who, having partaken of every delicacy, and
often had too much of good things, anxiously seeks new sensations
for his <i>blasé</i> palate. Anon, we have a hostess, anxious to
outshine friends with whom she has been invited to dine, and
whom she afterwards invites to dine with her.</p>

<p>Novelty! It is the prevailing cry; it is imperiously demanded
by everyone.</p>

<p>For all that, the number of alimentary substances is comparatively
small, the number of their combinations is not
infinite, and the amount of raw material placed either by art or
by nature at the disposal of a cook does not grow in proportion
to the whims of the public.</p>

<p>What feats of ingenuity have we not been forced to perform,
at times, in order to meet our customers’ wishes? Those only
who have had charge of a large, modern kitchen can tell the
tale. Personally, I have ceased counting the nights spent in
the attempt to discover new combinations, when, completely
broken with the fatigue of a heavy day, my body ought to have
been at rest.</p>

<p>Yet, the Chef who has had the felicity to succeed in turning
out an original and skilful preparation approved by his public
and producing a vogue, cannot, even for a time, claim the
monopoly of his secret discovery, or derive any profit therefrom.
The painter, sculptor, writer and musician are protected by
law. So are inventors. But the chef has absolutely no redress
for plagiarism on his work; on the contrary, the more the latter
is liked and appreciated, the more will people clamour for his
recipes. Many hours of hard work perhaps underlie his latest
creation, if it have reached the desired degree of perfection.</p>

<p>He may have forfeited his recreation and even his night’s
rest, and have laboured without a break over his combination;
and, as a reward, he finds himself compelled, morally at least,
to convey the result of his study to the first person who asks,
and who, very often, subsequently claims the invention of the
recipe—to the detriment of the real author’s chances and reputation.</p>

<p>This frantic love of novelty is also responsible for many of
<a id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>viii<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the difficulties attending the arrangement of menus; for very
few people know what an arduous task the composing of a
perfect menu represents.</p>

<p>The majority—even of those who are accustomed to receptions
and the giving of dinners—suppose that a certain routine
alone is necessary, together with some culinary practice, in order
to write a menu; and few imagine that a good deal more is
needed than the mere inscription of Courses upon a slip of
pasteboard.</p>

<p>In reality the planning of these alimentary programmes is
among the most difficult problems of our art, and it is in
this very matter that perfection is so rarely reached. In the
course of more than forty years’ experience as a chef, I have
been responsible for thousands of menus, some of which have
since become classical and have ranked among the finest served
in modern times; and I can safely say, that in spite of the
familiarity such a period of time ought to give one with the
work, the setting-up of a presentable menu is rarely accomplished
without lengthy labour and much thought, and for all
that the result is not always to my satisfaction. From this it
may be seen how slender are the claims of those who, without
any knowledge of our art, and quite unaware of the various
properties belonging to the substances we use, pretend to
arrange a proper menu.</p>

<p>However difficult the elaboration of a menu may be, it is
but the first and by no means the only difficulty which results
from the rapidity with which meals are served nowadays. The
number of dishes set before the diners being considerably
reduced, and the dishes themselves having been deprived of all
the advantages which their sumptuous decorations formerly lent
them, they must recover, by means of perfection and delicacy,
sufficient in the way of quality to compensate for their diminished
bulk and reduced splendour. They must be faultless in
regard to quality; they must be savoury and light. The choice
of the raw material, therefore, is a matter demanding vast
experience on the part of the chef; for the old French adage
which says that “<i>La sauce fait passer le poisson</i>” has long since
ceased to be true, and if one do not wish to court disapprobation—often
well earned—the fish should not be in the slightest
degree inferior to its accompanying sauce.</p>

<p>While on the subject of raw material, I should like, <i>en
passant</i>, to call attention to a misguided policy which seems
to be spreading in private houses and even in some commercial
establishments; I refer to the custom which, arising as it doubtless
<a id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>ix<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>does from a mistaken idea of economy, consists of entrusting
the choice of kitchen provisions to people unacquainted with
the profession, and who, never having used the goods which
they have to buy, are able to judge only very superficially of
their quality or real value, and cannot form any estimate of
their probable worth after the cooking process.</p>

<p>If economy were verily the result of such a policy none
would object to it. But the case is exactly the reverse; for, in
the matter of provisions, as in all commercial matters, the
cheapest is the dearest in the end. To obtain good results,
good material in a sufficient quantity must be used, and, in
order to obtain good material, the latter should be selected by
the person who is going to use it, and who knows its qualities
and properties. Amphitryons who set aside these essential principles
may hope in vain to found a reputation for their tables.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the greater part of the titles in this
work have been left in French. I introduced, or rather promulgated
this system, because, since it is growing every day more
customary to write menus in French, it will allow those who are
unacquainted with the language to accomplish the task with
greater ease. Moreover, many of the titles—especially those of
recent creations—are quite untranslatable. As the index, however,
is in English, and in every case the order number of each
recipe accompanies the number of the page where it is to be
found, no confusion can possibly arise. I have also allowed
certain French technical terms, for which there exist no English
equivalents, to remain in their original form, and these will be
found explained in a glossary at the end of the book.</p>

<p>I preferred to do this rather than strain the meaning of
certain English words, in order to fit them to a slightly unusual
application; and in so doing I only followed a precedent which
has been established on a more or less large scale by such
authors of English books on French cooking as Francatelli,
Gouffé, Ranhoffer, etc.</p>

<p>But the example for such verbal adoptions was set long ago
in France, where sporting and other terms, for which no suitable
native words could be found, were borrowed wholesale from the
English language, and gallicised. It is therefore not unreasonable
to apply the principle to terms in cookery which, though
plentiful and varied in France, are scarce in this country.</p>

<p>To facilitate the reading of the recipes, all words which are
not in common use, and of which the explanation will be found
in the <a href="#png.015">Glossary</a>, are italicised in the text.</p>

<p>In concluding this preface, which, I fear, has already
<a id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>x<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>overreached the bounds I intended for it, I should like to thank
those of my lady clients as well as many English epicures whose
kind appreciation has been conducive to the writing of this work.
I trust they will favour the latter with the generous consideration
of which they have so frequently given the author valuable
proofs, and for which he is glad of an opportunity of expressing
his deep gratitude.</p>

<h2 class="chap-nobreak" title="Chapter I: Fonds de Cuisine">CHAPTER I<br
 ><small class="allsc">FONDS DE CUISINE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">Before</span> undertaking the description of the different kinds of
dishes whose recipes I purpose giving in this work, it will be
necessary to reveal the groundwork whereon these recipes are
built. And, although this has already been done again and
again, and is wearisome in the extreme, a text-book on cooking
that did not include it would be not only incomplete, but in
many cases incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it is the usual procedure, in
culinary matters, to insist upon the importance of the part
played by stock, I feel compelled to refer to it at the outset
of this work, and to lay even further stress upon what has
already been written on the subject.</p>

<p>Indeed, stock is everything in cooking, at least in French
cooking. Without it, nothing can be done. If one’s stock is
good, what remains of the work is easy; if, on the other hand,
it is bad or merely mediocre, it is quite hopeless to expect anything
approaching a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>The workman mindful of success, therefore, will naturally
direct his attention to the faultless preparation of his stock, and,
in order to achieve this result, he will find it necessary not
merely to make use of the freshest and finest goods, but also
to exercise the most scrupulous care in their preparation, for,
in cooking, care is half the battle. Unfortunately, no theories,
no formulæ, and no recipes, however well written, can take the
place of practical experience in the acquisition of a full knowledge
concerning this part of the work—the most important,
the most essential, and certainly the most difficult part.</p>

<p>In the matter of stock it is, above all, necessary to have a
sufficient quantity of the finest materials at one’s disposal.
The master or mistress of a house who stints in this respect
thereby deliberately forfeits his or her right to make any remark
<a id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whatsoever to the <i>chef</i> concerning his work, for, let the talent
or merits of the latter be what they may, they are crippled by
insufficient or inferior material. It is just as absurd to exact
excellent cooking from a <i>chef</i> whom one provides with defective
or scanty goods, as to hope to obtain wine from a bottled
decoction of logwood.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="The Principal Kinds of Fonds de Cuisine">The Principal Kinds of Fonds de Cuisine (Foundation
Sauces and Stocks)</h3>

<p>The principal kinds of fonds de cuisine <span class="nw">are:—</span></p>

<p>1. Ordinary and clarified consommés.</p>

<p>2. The brown stock or “<i>estouffade</i>,” game stocks, the bases
of thickened gravies and of brown sauces.</p>

<p>3. White stock, basis of white sauces.</p>

<p>4. Fish stock.</p>

<p>5. The various essences of poultry, game, fish, &amp;c., the
complements of small sauces.</p>

<p>6. The various glazes: meat, game, and poultry.</p>

<p>7. The basic sauces: Espagnole, Velouté, Béchamel,
Tomato, and Hollandaise.</p>

<p>8. The savoury jellies or aspics of old-fashioned cooking.</p>

<p>To these kinds of stock, which, in short, represent the
buttresses of the culinary edifice, must now be added the following
preparations, which are, in a measure, the auxiliaries of
the <span class="nw">above:—</span></p>

<p>1. The roux, the cohering element in sauces.</p>

<p>2. The “<a href="#g_mirepoix">Mirepoix</a>” and “Matignon” aromatic and
flavouring elements.</p>

<p>3. The “<i>Court-Bouillon</i>” and the “<i>Blancs</i>.”</p>

<p>4. The various stuffings.</p>

<p>5. The <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinades</a></i>.</p>

<p>6. The various garnishes for soups, for relevés, for entrées, &amp;c. (“Duxelle,” “Duchesse,” “Dauphine,” <i><a href="#g_pate_a_choux">Pâte à choux</a></i>,

<h3 class="recipe" title="1—Ordinary or White Consommé"><a id="rcp.1"
 >1—ORDINARY OR WHITE CONSOMMÉ</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>3 lbs. of shin of beef.</p>
<p>3 lbs. of lean beef.</p>
<p>1½ lbs. of fowls’ carcases.</p>
<p>1 lb. of carrots.</p>
<p>½ lb. of turnips.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>3<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Preparation.</i>—Put the meat into a stock-pot of suitable
dimensions, after having previously strung it together; add
the poultry carcase, five quarts of water, and one-half oz. of
grey salt. Place the stock-pot on a moderate fire in such a
manner that it may not boil too quickly, and remember to
stir the meat from time to time. Under the influence of the
heat, the water gradually reaches the interior of the meat,
where, after having dissolved the liquid portions, it duly combines
with them. These liquid portions contain a large proportion
of albumen, and as the temperature of the water rises
this substance has a tendency to coagulate. It also increases
in volume, and, by virtue of its lightness, escapes from the
water and accumulates on the surface in the form of scum.
Carefully remove this scum as it forms, and occasionally add
a little cold water before the boil is reached in order that, the
latter being retarded, a complete expulsion of the scum may
be effected. The clearness of the consommé largely depends
upon the manner in which this skimming has been carried
out. Then the vegetable garnishing is added. The scum from
these is removed as in the previous case, and the edge of the
stock-pot should be carefully wiped to the level of the fluid, so
as to free it from the deposit which has been formed there.
The stock-pot is then moved to a corner of the fire where it
may continue cooking slowly for four or five hours. At the
end of this time it should be taken right away from the fire,
and, after half a pint of cold water has been added to its contents,
it should be left to rest a few minutes with a view to
allowing the grease to accumulate on the surface of the liquid,
whence it must be carefully removed before the consommé is
strained. This last operation is effected by means of a very
fine strainer, placed on the top of a white tureen (clean and
wide), which should then be placed in a draught to hasten the
cooling of the consommé. The tureen should not on any
account be covered, and this more particularly in summer,
when rapid cooling is a precautionary measure against fermentation.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Remarks upon the Different Causes which Combine to
Influence the Quality of a Consommé">Remarks upon the Different Causes which Combine to
Influence the Quality of a Consommé</h3>

<p>It will be seen that I have not made any mention in the
above formula of the meat and the vegetables which have
helped to make the consommé, my reason being that it is
preferable to remove them from the stock-pot only after the
<a id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>broth has been strained, so as not to run the risk of disturbing
the latter.</p>

<p>The quality of the meat goes a long way towards settling
the quality of the consommé. In order that the latter be perfect,
it is essential that the meat used should be that of comparatively
old animals whose flesh is well set and rich in flavour. This
is a <i>sine quâ non</i>, and the lack of meat coming from old animals
in England accounts for the difficulty attaching to the making
of a good consommé and savoury sauces in this country. Cattle
in England are killed at an age varying from three to four years
at the most; the meat thus obtained has no equal for the
purpose of roasts and grills, and anything approaching it is
rarely met with on the Continent. But when this same meat
is used for boiling or braising, it does not contain enough juice
or flavour to yield a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>This shortcoming is furthermore aggravated by a fault that
many commit who are employed in the making of consommés
and stock. The fault in question consists in cooking the bones
simultaneously with the meat. Now to extract that gelatinous
element from bone which produces the mellowness characteristic
of all good consommés, it is necessary that the gelatigenous
bodies should be cooked for twelve hours at least, and even
after that time has elapsed they are still not entirely spent.
On the Continent the quality of the meat easily compensates
for this technical error, but such is certainly not the case in
England, where five hours’ stewing only results in a flat and
insipid consommé.</p>

<p>I therefore believe that, in the case of either consommé or
stock, the formulæ of which I shall give later, it would be advisable
for the bones to stew at least twelve hours, and this only
after they have been well broken up, while the quantity of water
used should be so calculated as to suffice exactly for the immersion
of the meat that must follow. The contents of this
first stock-pot should include half of the vegetables mentioned,
and the consommé thus obtained, after having been strained and
cooled, will take the place of the water in the recipe, in accordance
with the directions I have given above.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="The Uses of White Consommé">The Uses of White Consommé</h3>

<p>White consommé is used in the preparation of clarified consommés,
in which case it undergoes a process of clarifying, the
directions for which will be given later. It also serves as the
liquor for thick soups, poached fowls, &amp;c. It must be limpid,
<a id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as colourless as possible, and very slightly salted, for, whatever
the use may be for which it is intended, it has to undergo
a process of concentration.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2—The Preparation of Clarified Consommé for Clear Soups"><a id="rcp.2"
 >2—THE PREPARATION OF CLARIFIED CONSOMMÉ <span class="nw">FOR CLEAR SOUPS</span></a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities for making four quarts.</i>—Five quarts of ordinary
consommé, one and one-half lbs. of very lean beef, the white
of an egg, one fowl’s carcase (roasted if possible). First,
mince the beef and pound it in a mortar with the fowl’s carcase
and the white of egg, adding a little cold white consommé.
Put the whole into a tall, narrow, and thick-bottomed stewpan;
then gradually add the cold, white broth, from which all grease
has been removed, that the whole may be well mixed.
Then the stewpan may be put on the fire, and its contents
thoroughly stirred, for fear of their burning at the bottom.
When boiling-point is reached, move the stewpan to a corner
of the fire, so that the soup may only simmer, for anything
approaching the boil would disturb the contents. A good hour
should be enough to properly finish the consommé, and any
longer time on the fire would be rather prejudicial than the
reverse, as it would probably impair the flavour of the preparation.
Now carefully remove what little grease may have collected
on the surface of the consommé, and strain the latter
through muslin into another clean stewpan. It is now ready
for the addition of the garnishes that are to form part of it,
which I shall enumerate in due course.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Remarks upon Clarifications">Remarks upon Clarifications</h3>

<p>For clarified consommés, even more than for the ordinary
kind, it is eminently advisable that the meat should be that
of old animals. Indeed, it is safe to say that one lb. of meat
coming from an animal of eight years will yield much better
consommé than two lbs. would, coming from a fattened
animal of about three or four years. The consommé will be
stronger, mellower, and certainly more tasty, as the flesh of
young animals has absolutely no richness of flavour.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I do not refer to any vegetable for the
clarification. If the white consommé has been well carried out,
it should be able to dispense with all supplementary flavouring,
and, the customary error of cooks being rather to overdo the
quantity of vegetables—even to the extent of disguising the
natural aroma of the consommé—I preferred to entirely abandon
<a id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the idea of vegetable garnishes in clarifications, and thus avoid
a common stumbling-block.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="3—Chicken Consommé"><a id="rcp.3"
 >3—CHICKEN CONSOMMÉ</a></h3>

<p>White chicken consommé is prepared in exactly the same
way as ordinary white consommé. There need only be added
to the meat, the quantity of which may be lessened, an old hen
or a cock, slightly coloured on the spit or in the oven.</p>

<p>For the clarification, the quantity of roast fowl-carcases
used may be increased, provided the latter be not too fat. The
process, however, is the same as in the clarification of ordinary
consommés.</p>

<p>The colour of chicken consommé should be lighter than that
of the ordinary kind—namely, a light, amber yellow, limpid
and warm.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="4—Fish Consommé"><a id="rcp.4"
 >4—FISH CONSOMMÉ</a></h3>

<p>These consommés are rarely used, for Lenten soups with a
fish basis are generally thick soups, for the preparation of
which the fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> whereof I shall give the formula later
(Formula No. <a href="#rcp.11">11</a>) should avail. Whenever there is no definite
reason for the use of an absolutely Lenten consommé, it would
be advisable to resort to one of the ordinary kind, and to finish
off the same by means of a good fish essence extracted from
the bones of a sole or whiting. An excellent consommé is thus
obtained, more palatable and less flat than the plain fish consommé.</p>

<p>If, however, one were obliged to make a plain fish consommé,
the following procedure should be <span class="nw">adopted:—</span></p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Clarification of Fish Consommé">Clarification of Fish Consommé</h3>

<p><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i>—Four and one-half
quarts of ordinary fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency --> having a decided taste; one-half lb. of good fresh caviare, or pressed caviare.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Pound the caviare and mix the resulting
pulp with the cold fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. Put the whole into a saucepan,
place it on the open fire, and stir with a spatula until the
contents reach the boil. Then move the saucepan to a corner
of the fire, and let the consommé simmer gently for twenty
minutes, after which strain it through muslin with great caution,
and keep it well covered and in the warmth, so as to prevent
the formation of a gelatinous film on the surface.</p>

<p>Fish consommés are greatly improved by the addition of
<a id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>such aromatics as saffron or curry, both of which considerably
add to their quality.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="5—Game Consommé"><a id="rcp.5"
 >5—GAME CONSOMMÉ<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>The necks, breasts, and shoulders of venison and of hare,
old wild rabbits, old pheasants, and old partridges may be used
in the production of game consommés. An ordinary consommé
may likewise be made, in which half the beef can be replaced
by veal, and to which may be added, while clarifying, a succulent
game essence. This last method is even preferable when
dealing with feathered game, but in either case it is essential
that the meat used should be half-roasted beforehand, in order
to strengthen the <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>

<p>The formula that I give below must therefore only be looked
upon as a model, necessarily alterable according to the resources
at one’s disposal, the circumstances, and the end in view.</p>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts of Plain Game Consommé.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>3 lbs. of neck, shoulder, or breast of venison.</p>
<p>1½ lbs. of hare-trimmings.</p>
<p>1 old pheasant or 2 partridges.</p>
<p>4 oz. of sliced carrots, browned in butter.</p>
<p>½ lb. of mushrooms, likewise browned in butter.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>1 medium-sized leek and 2 sticks of celery.</p>
<p>1 bunch of herbs with extra thyme and bay leaves.</p>
<p>1 onion, oven-browned, with 2 cloves stuck into it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Liquor.</i>—Five and one-half quarts of water.</p>

<p><i>Seasoning.</i>—One oz. of salt and a few peppercorns, these
to be added ten minutes previous to straining the consommé.</p>

<p><i>Time allowed for cooking.</i>—Three hours.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Proceed in exactly the same way as for
ordinary consommés, taking care only to half-roast the meat,
as I pointed out above, before putting it in the stewpan.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="The Clarification of Game Consommés">The Clarification of Game Consommés</h3>

<p>The constituents of the clarification of game consommés
vary according to the kind of consommé desired. If it is to
have a partridge flavour, one partridge should be allowed for
each quart of the consommé, whereas if its flavour is to be
that of the pheasant, half an old pheasant will be required per
each quart of the liquid. Lastly, in the case of plain game
consommés, one lb. of lean venison, hare, or wild rabbit should
be allowed for each quart of the required consommé.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Whatever be the kind of game used,
the latter must be thoroughly boned and the meat well pounded,
together with the white of an egg per four quarts of consommé.
<a id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>About two oz. per quart of dried mushrooms should now be
added if they can be procured, while the bones and the remains
or carcases of game should be browned in the oven and completely
drained of all grease. The whole can now be mixed
with the cold game consommé. The clarification is then put
over an open fire (stirring incessantly the while), and as soon
as the boil is reached the saucepan must be moved to a corner
of the fire, where its contents may gently boil for three-quarters
of an hour. The fat should then be removed, and the consommé
strained through muslin, after which cover up until
wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="6—Special Consommés for Suppers"><a id="rcp.6"
 >6—SPECIAL CONSOMMÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible --> FOR SUPPERS</a></h3>

<p>The consommés whose formulæ I have just given are intended
more particularly for dinners. They are always finished
off by some kind of garnish, which, besides lending them an
additional touch of flavour, gives them their special and definite
character when they are served up in the diner’s plate.</p>

<p>But the case is otherwise with the consommés served for
suppers. These, being only served in cups, either hot or cold,
do not allow of any garnishing, since they are to be <i>drunk</i> at
table. They must therefore be perfect in themselves, delicate,
and quite clear.</p>

<p>These special consommés are made in a similar manner to
the others, though it is needful to slightly increase the quantity
of meat used for the clarification, and to add to that clarification
the particular flavour mentioned on the <i>menu</i>—to wit, a few
stalks of celery, if the consommé is a celery one; a small
quantity of curry, if the consommé is given as “à l’Indienne”;
or a few old roast partridges if it is to be termed “Consommé
au <a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a> de perdreau”; and so on.</p>

<p>The means by which one may vary the aroma of consommés
are legion, but it is highly important, what aroma
soever be used, that the latter be not too pronounced. It ought
only to lend a distinctive and, at the same time, subtle finish
to the consommé, which, besides sharpening the latter, should
increase its succulence.</p>

<p>When the consommé is served cold it ought to have the
qualities of an extremely light and easily-melting jelly, barely
firm; but when it is too liquid, it rarely gives that sensation of
perfection and succulence to the palate of the consumer which
the latter expects. When too firm and too gelatinous it is
positively disagreeable; therefore, if it is to be relished, it
should be just right in respect of consistency.</p>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>4 lbs. of shin of beef (flesh and bone).</p>
<p>4 lbs. of shin of veal (flesh and bone).</p>
<p>½ lb. of lean, raw ham.</p>
<p>½ lb. of fresh pork rind, rinsed in tepid water.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>¾ lb. of minced carrots, browned in butter.</p>
<p>¾ lb. of minced onions, browned in butter.</p>
<p>1 faggot, containing a little parsley, a stick of celery, a small sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Bone and string the meat, and keep it in
readiness for the morrow. Break the bones as finely as possible,
and, after having besprinkled them with a little stock-fat,
brown them in an oven; also stir them repeatedly. When they
are slightly browned, put them in a conveniently large saucepan
with the carrots, the onions, and the faggot. Add five
quarts of cold water, and put the saucepan on an open fire
to boil. As soon as the boil is reached skim carefully; wipe
the edge of the saucepan; put the lid half on, and allow the
stock to cook gently for twelve hours; then roughly remove
the fat; pass the liquid through a sieve, and let it cool.</p>

<p>This being done, put the meat in a saucepan just large
enough to hold it. Brown it a little in some stock-fat, and
clear it entirely of the latter. Add half a pint of the prepared
stock, cover the saucepan, and let the meat simmer on the side
of the fire until the stock is almost entirely reduced. Meanwhile
the meat should have been repeatedly turned, that it may
be equally affected throughout. Now pour the remainder of
the stock, prepared from bones, into the saucepan, bring the
whole to the boil, and then move the saucepan to a corner of
the fire for the boiling to continue very slowly and regularly
with the lid off. As soon as the meat is well cooked the fat
should be removed from the stock, and the latter should be
strained or rubbed through a sieve, after which it should be
put aside to be used when required.</p>

<p><i>Remarks Relative to the Making of Brown Stock.</i>—Instead
of stringing the meat after having boned it, if time presses,
it may be cut into large cubes before browning. In this case
one hour and a half would suffice to cook it and to extract all
its juice.</p>

<p>Whether brown or white, stock should never be salted,
because it is never served in its original state. It is either
reduced in order to make glazes or sauces—in which case the
concentration answers the purpose of seasoning—or else it is
<a id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>used to cook meat which must be salted before being cooked,
and which, therefore, imparts the necessary salt to its surrounding
liquor.</p>

<p>Brown stock ought to be the colour of fine burnt amber,
and it must be transparent. It is used in making meat-glazes
after reduction, also to moisten meat for braising and to prepare
brown sauces.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="8—Brown Game Stock"><a id="rcp.8"
 >8—BROWN GAME STOCK</a></h3>

<p>There is no difference between the game consommés and
game stock, or, otherwise stated, ordinary game consommé
and brown game stock are one and the same thing. The distinction
lies in the ultimate use of this preparation; it is clarified,
as we have shown (Formula <a href="#rcp.5">5</a>), if it be intended for a clear
soup, and it is used in its original state if it is to be used for
a thick game soup, for a sauce, or for reducing.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="9—Brown Veal Stock"><a id="rcp.9"
 >9—BROWN VEAL STOCK</a></h3>

<p>Brown veal stock requires the same quantities of shin and
trimmings of veal as white veal stock (Formula <a href="#rcp.10">10</a>). The time
allowed for cooking is, however, a little shorter, and this operation
may be completed within eight hours. This stock is mostly
used as the liquor for poultry and <a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a> game, while it may
also serve in the preparation of thickened veal stock. Being
quite neutral in taste, it lends itself to all purposes, and readily
takes up the aroma of the meat with which it may happen to
be combined. It is admirably suited to the poaching of quails,
and nothing can supplant it in this particular.</p>

 >10—WHITE VEAL STOCK, AND POULTRY STOCK</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>8 lbs. of shin of veal, or lean and fresh veal trimmings.</p>
<p>1 or 2 fowls’ carcases, raw if they are handy.</p>
<p>12 oz. of carrots.</p>
<p>6 oz. of onions stuck with a clove.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>5½ quarts of cold water.</p>
<p>4 oz. of leeks strung with a stick of celery.</p>
<p>1 faggot, including 1 oz. of parsley, 1 bay leaf, and a small sprig of thyme.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Bone the shins, string the meat, break up the
bones as small as possible, and put them in a stewpan with the
water. Place on an open fire, allow to boil, skim carefully,
and then move to a side of the fire to cook very gently for
<a id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>five hours. At the end of this time put the stock into another
stewpan, add the meat and the vegetables, add water, if necessary,
to keep the quantity of liquid at five quarts, let it boil,
and allow it to cook slowly for another three hours, after which
remove all grease from the stock, pass the latter through a fine
strainer or a colander, and put it aside until wanted.</p>

<p><i>Remarks upon White Stock.</i>—One should contrive to make
this stock as gelatinous as possible. It is therefore an indispensable
measure that the bones be well broken up and cooked
for at least eight hours. Veal never yields such clear stock
as beef; nevertheless, the consommé obtained from veal should
not be turbid. It must, on the contrary, be kept as clear and
as white as possible.</p>

<p><i>Poultry Stock</i> is made by adding two old fowls to the above
veal stock, and these should be put into the liquor with the meat.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="11—White Fish Stock"><a id="rcp.11"
 >11—WHITE FISH STOCK</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>4 lbs. of trimmings and bones of sole or whiting.</p>
<p>½ lb. of sliced, <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> onions.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>2 oz. of parsley, root or stalks.</p>
<p>½ bottle of white wine.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Butter the bottom of a thick, tall stewpan,
put in the <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> onions and the parsley-stalks, and upon
these aromatics lay the fish remains. Add the juice of a lemon,
cover the stewpan, put it on the fire, and allow the fish to
exude its essence, jerking the pan at intervals. Moisten, in
the first place, with the white wine; then, with the lid off, reduce
the liquid to about half. Now add four quarts of cold water,
bring to the boil, skim, and then leave to cook for twenty
minutes, only, on a moderate fire. The time allowed is ample
for the purpose of extracting the aromatic and gelatinous
properties contained in the bones, and a more protracted stewing
would only impair the savour of the stock.</p>

<p><i>Remarks upon White Fish Stock.</i>—The formula which I
give above diverges considerably from that commonly used,
for, as a rule, fish stock is diluted far too much, and is stewed
for much too long a time. I have observed that fish stock may
be greatly improved by rapid cooking, and it was this consideration
that led me to dilute it scantily, so as to avoid prolonged
reduction.</p>

<p><a id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It is likewise necessary to remember that in order to make
perfect fish stock, only the sole or whiting should be used. In
a case of emergency, however, <i>i.e.</i>, if the supply of the latter
were to run short, a quarter of their weight of brill bones might
be added to them. But all other kinds of fish should be avoided
in the preparation.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="12—Fish Stock with Red Wine"><a id="rcp.12"
 >12—FISH STOCK WITH RED WINE</a></h3>

<p>This stock is comparatively rarely used, because, in practice,
it is naturally obtained in the cooking of the fish itself, as, for
instance, in the case of the “Matelotes.” Be this as it may,
with the recent incursion of a custom which seems to demand,
ever more and more, the serving of fish without bones, the
following formula will be worthy of interest, as it is likely that
its need will henceforth be felt with increasing urgency.</p>

<p>Fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> with red wine may be prepared from all fresh-water
fish, as well as from the remains of sole, whiting, chicken-turbot,
and brill. It is generally better, however, to have recourse
to the bones and remains of that fish which happens to
be constituting the dish—that is to say, the bones and trimmings
of sole in a stock for fillet of sole, the bones and trimmings of
a chicken-turbot in a <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> for a chicken-turbot, and so on. The
preparatory formula remains the same, whatever the kind of
fish used may be.</p>

<p><i>Quantities for making Four Quarts of</i> <a href="#g_fumet">Fumet</a> <i>with Red
Wine</i>.—Four lbs. of bones, heads, and trimmings of the fish
to be served; three-quarters lb. of minced white onions; three oz. of parsley stalks, two bay leaves, four small sprigs of thyme,
and four cloves of garlic; two bottles of red wine and four pints
of water.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Put all the above-mentioned ingredients
in a thick and tall stewpan, boil, skim carefully, and
allow to cook twenty to thirty minutes on a moderate fire; then
strain the stock through a colander into a tureen, to be used
when required.</p>

<p><i>Remarks upon Fish Stock with Red Wine.</i>—This stock
stands reduction far better than white fish stock. Nevertheless,
I urge the advisability of trying to obtain the required quantity
without reduction. In its preparation, one may use some mushroom
parings, as in the case of white stock, if these are handy,
and they will be found to lend an agreeable flavour to the fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="13—Various Essences"><a id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.13"
 >13—VARIOUS ESSENCES</a></h3>

<p>As their name implies, essences are stock which hold a large
proportion of a substance’s aroma in a concentrated form. They
are, in fact, ordinary stock, only less diluted, with the idea
of intensifying the flavour of the treated ingredients; hence
their utility is <i>nil</i> if the stock which they are intended to finish
has been reasonably and judiciously treated. It is infinitely
simpler to make savoury and succulent stock in the first place
than to produce a mediocre stock, and finally complete it by a
specially prepared essence. The result in the first instance is
better, and there is economy of time and material.</p>

<p>The most one can do is to recommend, in certain circumstances,
the use of essences extracted from particularly well-flavoured
products, as, for instance, mushrooms, truffles, morels,
and celery. But it would be well to remember that, nine times
out of ten, it is preferable to add the product itself to the stock
during the preparation of the same than to prepare essences.</p>

<p>For this reason I do not think it necessary to dilate upon
the subject of essences, the need of which should not be felt
in good cooking.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="14—Various Glazes"><a id="rcp.14"
 >14—VARIOUS GLAZES</a></h3>

<p>The various glazes of meat, fowl, game, and fish are merely
stock reduced to the point of viscosity. Their uses are legion.
Occasionally they serve in decking dishes with a brilliant and
unctuous coating which makes them sightly; at other times
they may help to strengthen the consistence of a sauce or other
culinary preparation, while again they may be used as sauces
proper after they have been correctly creamed or buttered.</p>

<p>Glazes are distinguished from essences by the fact that the
latter are only prepared with the object of extracting all the
flavour of the product under treatment, whereas the former are,
on the contrary, constituted by the whole base of the substance
itself. They therefore have not only its savour, but also
its succulence and mellowness, whereby they are superior to
the essences, and cooking can but be improved by substituting
them for the latter. Nevertheless, many <i>chefs</i> of the old school
do not permit the use of glazes in culinary preparations, or,
rather, they are of opinion that each cooking operation should
produce them on its own account, and thus be sufficient unto
itself. Certainly, the theory is correct when neither time nor
cost is limited. But nowadays the establishments are scarce
where these theories may be applied, and, indeed, if one does
<a id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not make an abuse of glazes, and if they be prepared with care,
their use gives excellent results, while they lend themselves
admirably to the very complex demands of modern customs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="15—Meat Glaze"><a id="rcp.15"
 >15—MEAT GLAZE</a></h3>

<p>Meat glaze is made by reducing brown stock (Formula <a href="#rcp.7">7</a>)
in a large stewpan upon an open fire. As often as the stock
is appreciably reduced, during ebullition, it may be transferred
to smaller stewpans, taking care to strain it through muslin at
each change of stewpan. The glaze may be considered sufficiently
reduced when it evenly veneers a withdrawn spoon. The
fire used for reducing should gradually wane as the concentration
progresses, and the last phase must be effected slowly and
on a moderate fire.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to obtain a lighter and clearer glaze,
the brown veal stock (Formula <a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>) should be reduced instead
of the “<i>Estouffade</i>.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="16—Poultry Glaze"><a id="rcp.16"
 >16—POULTRY GLAZE</a></h3>

<p>Reduce the poultry base indicated in Formula <a href="#rcp.10">10</a>, and
proceed in exactly the same way as for meat glaze (Formula <a href="#rcp.15">15</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="17—Game Glaze"><a id="rcp.17"
 >17—GAME GLAZE</a></h3>

<p>Use the game base (Formula <a href="#rcp.8">8</a>), and proceed as for meat
glaze (Formula <a href="#rcp.15">15</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="18—Fish Glaze"><a id="rcp.18"
 >18—FISH GLAZE</a></h3>

<p>This glaze is used less often than the preceding ones. As
it is only used to intensify the savour of sauces, it is sufficient
for this purpose to prepare a white fish stock (Formula <a href="#rcp.11">11</a>),
which may be diluted with the stock already prepared, and
which may be reduced according to the requirements. The
name of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> or fish essence is given to this preparation;
its flavour is more delicate than that of fish glaze, which it
replaces with advantage.</p>

<h2 class="chap" title="Chapter II: The Leading Warm Sauces"><a id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER II<br
 ><small class="allsc">THE LEADING WARM SAUCES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">Warm</span> sauces are of two kinds: the leading sauces, also
called “mother sauces,” and the small sauces, which are usually
derived from the first-named, and are generally only modified
forms thereof. Cooking stock only includes the leading sauces,
but I shall refer to the small hot sauces and the cold sauces at
the end of the auxiliary stock.</p>

<p>Experience, which plays such an important part in culinary
work, is nowhere so necessary as in the preparation of sauces,
for not only must the latter flatter the palate, but they must also
vary in savour, consistence and viscosity, in accordance with
the dishes they accompany. By this means, in a well-ordered
dinner, each dish differs from the preceding ones and from those
that follow.</p>

<p>Furthermore, sauces must, through the perfection of their
preparation, obey the general laws of a rational hygiene, wherefore
they should be served and combined in such wise as to
allow of easy digestion by the frequently disordered stomachs
of their consumers.</p>

<p>Carême was quite justified in pluming himself upon the fact
that during his stay at the English Court his master—the Prince
Regent—had assured him that he (Carême) was the only one
among those who had served his Highness whose cooking had
been at all easy of digestion. Carême had grasped the essential
truth that the richer the cooking is, the more speedily do the
stomach and palate tire of it. And, indeed, it is a great mistake
to suppose that, in order to do good cooking, it is necessary
to be prodigal in one’s use of all things. In reality, practice
dictates fixed and regular quantities, and from these one cannot
diverge without upsetting the hygienic and sapid equilibrium
on which the value of a sauce depends. The requisite quantities
of each ingredient must, of course, be used, but neither
more nor less, as there are objections to either extreme.</p>

<p>Any sauce whatsoever should be smooth, light (without
<a id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>being liquid), glossy to the eye, and decided in taste. When
these conditions are fulfilled it is always easy to digest even
for tired stomachs.</p>

<p>An essential point in the making of sauces is the seasoning,
and it would be impossible for me to lay sufficient stress on the
importance of not indulging in any excess in this respect. It
too often happens that the insipidness of a badly-made sauce is
corrected by excessive seasoning; this is an absolutely deplorable
practice.</p>

<p>Seasoning should be so calculated as to be merely a complementary
factor, which, though it must throw the savour of
dishes into relief, may not form a recognisable part of them.
If it be excessive, it modifies and even destroys the taste peculiar
to every dish—to the great detriment of the latter and of the
consumer’s health.</p>

<p>It is therefore desirable that each sauce should possess its
own special flavour, well defined, the result of the combined
flavours of all its ingredients.</p>

<p>If, in the making of sauces, one allowed oneself to be guided
by those principles which are the very foundation of good
cookery, the general denunciation of sauces by the medical
faculty would be averted; and this denunciation no sauce deserves
if it be carefully prepared, conformably with the laws prescribed
by practice and its resulting experience.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="The Roux">The Roux</h3>

<p>The roux being the cohering element of leading sauces, it
is necessary to reveal its preparation and constituents before
giving one’s attention to the latter.</p>

<p>Three kinds of roux are used—namely, brown roux, for
brown sauces; pale roux, for veloutés, or cream sauces; and
white roux, for white sauces and Béchamel.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="19—Brown Roux"><a id="rcp.19"
 >19—BROWN ROUX</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities for making about One lb.</i>—Eight oz. of clarified
butter, nine oz. of best-quality flour.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Mix the flour and butter in a very thick stewpan,
and put it on the side of the fire or in a moderate oven.
Stir the mixture repeatedly so that the heat may be evenly
distributed throughout the whole of its volume.</p>

<p>The time allowed for the cooking of brown roux cannot be
precisely determined, as it depends upon the degree of heat
<a id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>employed. The more intense the latter, the speedier will
be the cooking, while the stirring will of necessity be more
rapid. Brown roux is known to be cooked when it has acquired
a fine, light brown colour, and when it exudes a scent resembling
that of the hazel-nut, characteristic of baked flour.</p>

<p>It is very important that brown roux should not be cooked
too rapidly. As a matter of fact, among the various constituent
elements of flour, the starch alone acts as the cohering principle.
This starch is contained in little cells, which tightly
constrain it, but which are sufficiently porous to permit the
percolation of liquid and fatty substances. Under the influence
of moderate heat and the infiltered butter, the cells burst
through the swelling of the starch, and the latter thereupon
completely combines with the butter to form a mass capable of
absorbing six times its own weight of liquid when cooked.</p>

<p>When the cooking takes place with a very high initial heat
the starch gets burned within its shrivelled cells, and swelling is
then possible only in those parts which have been least burned.</p>

<p>The cohering principle is thus destroyed, and double or
treble the quantity of roux becomes necessary in order to obtain
the required consistency. But this excess of roux in the sauce
chokes it up without binding it, and prevents it from despumating
or becoming clear. At the same time, the cellulose and
the burnt starch lend a bitterness to the sauce of which no
subsequent treatment can rid it.</p>

<p>From the above it follows that, starch being the only one
from among the different constituents of flour which really
effects the coherence of sauces, there would be considerable
advantage in preparing roux either from a pure form of it, or
from substances with kindred properties, such as fecula, arrow-root, &amp;c. It is only habit that causes flour to be still used as
the cohering element of roux, and, indeed, the hour is not so
far distant when the advantages of the changes I propose will
be better understood—changes which have been already recommended
by Favre in his dictionary.</p>

<p>With a roux well made from the purest starch—in which
case the volume of starch and butter would equal about half that
of the flour and butter of the old method—and with strong and
succulent brown stock, a Spanish sauce or Espagnole may be
made in one hour. And this sauce will be clearer, more brilliant,
and better than that of the old processes, which needed three
days at least to despumate.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="20—Pale Roux"><a id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.20"
 >20—PALE ROUX</a></h3>

<p>The quantities are the same as for brown roux, but cooking
must cease as soon as the colour of the roux begins to change,
and before the appearance of any colouring whatsoever.</p>

<p>The observations I made relative to brown roux, concerning
the cohering element, apply also to pale roux.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="21—White Roux"><a id="rcp.21"
 >21—WHITE ROUX</a></h3>

<p>Same quantities as for brown and pale roux, but the time
of cooking is limited to a few minutes, as it is only needful, in
this case, to do away with the disagreeable taste of raw flour
which is typical of those sauces whose roux has not been sufficiently
cooked.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="22—Brown Sauce or Espagnole"><a id="rcp.22"
 >22—BROWN SAUCE OR ESPAGNOLE</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities Required for Four Quarts.</i>—One lb. of brown
roux dissolved in a tall, thick saucepan with six quarts of brown
stock or estouffade. Put the saucepan on an open fire, and stir
the sauce with a spatula or a whisk, and do not leave it until it
begins to boil. Then remove the spatula, and put the saucepan
on a corner of the fire, letting it lean slightly to one side
with the help of a wedge, so that boiling may only take place
at one point, and that the inert principles thrown out by the
sauce during despumation may accumulate high up in the saucepan,
whence they can be easily removed as they collect.</p>

<p>It is advisable during despumation to change saucepans twice
or even three times, straining every time, and adding a quart
of brown stock to replace what has evaporated. At length,
when the sauce begins to get lighter, and about two
hours before finally straining it, two lbs. of fresh tomatoes,
roughly cut up, should be added, or an equivalent quantity of
tomato purée, and about one lb. of <i>Mirepoix</i>, prepared according
to Formula No. <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>. The sauce is then reduced so as to
measure four quarts when strained, after which it is poured
into a wide tureen, and must be kept in motion until quite cool
lest a skin should form on its surface.</p>

<p>The time required for the despumation of an Espagnole
varies according to the quality of the stock and roux. We saw
above that one hour sufficed for a concentrated stock and starch
roux, in which case the <a href="#g_mirepoix">Mirepoix</a> and the tomato are inserted
from the first. But much more time is required if one is dealing
with a roux whose base is flour. In the latter case six hours
<a id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>should be allowed, provided one have excellent stock and well-made
roux. More often than not this work is done in two
stages, thus: after having despumated the Espagnole for six
or eight hours the first day, it is put on the fire the next day
with half its volume of stock, and it is left to despumate a few
hours more before it is finally strained.</p>

<p>Summing up my opinion on this subject, I can only give
my colleagues the following advice, based upon long <span class="nw">experience:—</span></p>

<p>1. Only use strong, clear stock with a decided taste.</p>

<p>2. Be scrupulously careful of the roux, however it may be
made. By following these two rules, a clear, brilliant, and
consistent Espagnole will always be obtained in a fairly short
time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="23—Half Glaze"><a id="rcp.23"
 >23—HALF GLAZE</a></h3>

<p>This is the Espagnole sauce, having reached the limit of perfection
by final despumation. It is obtained by reducing one
quart of Espagnole and one quart of first-class brown stock
until its volume is reduced to nine-tenths of a quart. It is then
strained into a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> of convenient dimensions, and it is
finished, away from the fire, with one-tenth of a quart of excellent
sherry. Cover the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, or slightly butter the top
to avoid the formation of a skin. This sauce is the base of all
the smaller brown sauces.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="24—Lenten Espagnole"><a id="rcp.24"
 >24—LENTEN ESPAGNOLE</a></h3>

<p>Practical men are not agreed as to the need of Lenten
Espagnole. The ordinary Espagnole being really a neutral
sauce in flavour, it is quite simple to give it the necessary flavour
by the addition of the required quantity of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. It is
only, therefore, when one wishes to conform with the demands
of a genuine Lent sauce that a fish Espagnole is needed. And,
certainly in this case, nothing can take its place.</p>

<p>The preparation of this Espagnole does not differ from that
of the ordinary kind, except that the bacon is replaced by mushroom
parings in the <a href="#g_mirepoix">Mirepoix</a>, and that the sauce must be despumated
for only one hour.</p>

<p>This sauce takes the place of the ordinary Espagnole, for
Lenten preparations, in every case where the latter is generally
used, in <a href="#g_gratin">Gratins</a>, in the Genevoise sauce, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="25—Ordinary Velouté Sauce"><a id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.25"
 >25—ORDINARY VELOUTÉ SAUCE</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities Required for Four Quarts.</i>—One lb. of pale roux
(Formula <a href="#rcp.20">20</a>), five quarts of white veal stock (Formula <a href="#rcp.10">10</a>).</p>

<p>Dissolve the roux in the cold white veal stock and put the
saucepan containing this mixture on an open fire, stirring the
sauce with a spatula or whisk, so as to avoid its burning at
the bottom. Add one oz. of table-salt, a pinch of nutmeg and
white powdered pepper, together with one-quarter lb. of nice
white mushroom parings, if these are handy. Now boil and
move to a corner of the fire to despumate slowly for one and a
half hours, at the same time observing the precautions advised
for ordinary Espagnole (Formula <a href="#rcp.22">22</a>). Strain through muslin
into a smaller saucepan, add one pint of white stock, and despumate
for another half hour. Strain it again through a tammy
or a sieve into a wide tureen, and keep moving it with a spatula
until it is quite cold.</p>

<p>I am not partial to garnishing Velouté Sauce with carrots,
an onion with a clove stuck into it, and a faggot, as
many do. The stock should be sufficiently fragrant of itself,
without requiring the addition of anything beyond the usual
condiments. The only exception I should make would be for
mushroom parings, even though it is preferable, when possible,
to replace these by mushroom liquor. But this is always scarce
in kitchens where it is used for other purposes; wherefore it is
often imperative to have recourse to parings in its stead. The
latter may not, however, be added to the stock itself, as they
would blacken it; hence I advise their addition to the Velouté
during its preparation.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="26—Velouté de Volaille"><a id="rcp.26"
 >26—VELOUTÉ DE VOLAILLE</a></h3>

<p>This is identical with ordinary Velouté, except that instead
of having white veal stock for its liquor, it is diluted with white
poultry stock. The mode of procedure and the time allowed for
cooking are the same.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="26a—Fish Velouté"><a id="rcp.26a"
 >26a—FISH VELOUTÉ</a></h3>

<p>Velouté is the base of various fish sauces whose recipes will
be given in Part II.</p>

<p>Prepare it in precisely the same way as poultry velouté,
but instead of using poultry stock, use very clear fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, and let it despumate for twenty minutes only. (See fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> No. <a href="#rcp.11">11</a>.)</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="27—Allemande Sauce or Thickened Velouté"><a id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.27"
 >27—ALLEMANDE SAUCE OR THICKENED VELOUTÉ</a></h3>

<p>Allemande Sauce is not, strictly speaking, a basic sauce.
However, it is so often resorted to in the preparation of other
sauces that I think it necessary to give it after the Veloutés,
from which it is derived.</p>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for One Quart.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>The yolks of 5 eggs.</p>
<p>1 pint of cold white stock.</p>
<p>1 quart of Velouté, well despu­mated.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>½ the juice of a lemon.</p>
<p>¼ pint of mushroom liquor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Put the various ingredients in a thick-bottomed
sauté-pan and mix them carefully. Then put the pan
on an open fire, and stir the sauce with a metal spatula, lest
it burn at the bottom. When the sauce has been reduced to
about one quart, add one-third pint of fresh cream to it, and
reduce further for a few minutes. It should then be passed
through a fine strainer into a tureen and kept moving until
quite cold.</p>

<p>Prepared thus, the Allemande Sauce is ready for the preparation
of the smaller sauces. Butter must only be added at the
very last moment, for if it were buttered any earlier it would
most surely turn. The same injunction holds good with this
sauce when it is to be served in its original state; it should then
receive a small addition of cream, and be buttered so that it
may attain its required delicacy; but this addition of butter and
cream ought only to be made at the last moment, and away from
the fire. When a sauce thickened with egg yolks has any fat
substance added to it, it cannot be exposed to a higher temperature
than 140 degrees Fahrenheit without risking decomposition.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="28—Béchamel Sauce"><a id="rcp.28"
 >28—BÉCHAMEL<!-- TN: acute invisible --> SAUCE</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>1 lb. of white roux.</p>
<p>4½ quarts of boiling milk.</p>
<p>½ lb. of lean veal.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>⅔ oz. of salt, 1 pinch of mignon­ette, and grated nutmeg, and 1 small sprig of thyme.</p>
<p>1 minced onion.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Pour the boiling milk on the roux, which
should be almost cold, and whisk it well so as to avoid lumps.
Let it boil, then cook on the side of the fire. Meanwhile the
lean veal should have been cut into small cubes, and fried
with butter in a saucepan, together with the minced onion.
When the veal has stiffened without becoming coloured, it is
added to the Béchamel, together with salt and the other aromatics.
Let the sauce boil slowly for about one hour in all,
<a id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and then pass it through a tammy into a tureen; butter the top,
lest a crust should form.</p>

<p>When Béchamel is intended for Lenten preparations, the
veal must be omitted.</p>

<p>There is another way of making the sauce. After having
boiled the milk, the seasoning and aromatics should be added;
the saucepan is then covered and placed on a corner of the
stove, so as to ensure a thorough infusion. The boiling milk
must now be poured on to the roux which has been separately
prepared, and the sauce should then cook for one quarter of an
hour only.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="29—Tomato Sauce"><a id="rcp.29"
 >29—TOMATO SAUCE</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>5 oz. of salted breast of pork, rather fat.</p>
<p>6 oz. of carrots cut into cubes.</p>
<p>6 oz. of onions cut into cubes.</p>
<p>1 bay leaf and 1 small sprig of thyme.</p>
<p>5 oz. of flour.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>2 oz. of butter, ½ oz. of salt, 1 oz. of sugar, a pinch of pepper.</p>
<p>10 lbs. of raw tomatoes or 4 quarts of same, mashed.</p>
<p>2 quarts of white stock.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Fry the pork with the butter in a tall, thick-bottomed
saucepan. When the pork is nearly melted, add the
carrots, onions, and aromatics. Cook and stir the vegetables,
then add the flour, which should be allowed to cook until it
begins to brown. Now put in the tomatoes and white stock,
mix the whole well, and set to boil on an open fire. At this
point add the seasoning and a crushed clove of garlic, cover
the saucepan, and place in a moderate oven, where it may cook
for one and one-half hours. At the end of this time the sauce
should be passed through a sieve or tammy, and it should boil
while being stirred. Finally, pour it into a tureen, and butter
its surface to avoid the formation of a skin.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—A purée of tomatoes is also used in cookery; it
is prepared in precisely the same fashion, except that the flour
is omitted and only one pint of white stock is added.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="30—Hollandaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.30"
 >30—HOLLANDAISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities Required for One Quart.</i>—One and one-half lbs.
of butter, the yolks of six eggs, one pinch of mignonette pepper
and one-quarter oz. of salt, three tablespoonfuls of good vinegar.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Put the salt, the mignonette, the vinegar, and
as much water in a small saucepan, and reduce by three-quarters
on the fire. Move the saucepan to a corner of the fire or into
<a id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, and add a spoonful of fresh water and the yolks.
Work the whole with a whisk until the yolks thicken and have
the consistence of cream. Then remove the saucepan to a tepid
place and gradually pour the butter on the yolks while briskly
stirring the sauce. When the butter is absorbed, the sauce
ought to be thick and firm. It is brought to the correct consistence
with a little water, which also lightens it slightly, but
the addition of water is optional. The sauce is completed by
a drop of lemon juice, and it is rubbed through a tammy.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The consistence of sauces whose processes are
identical with those of the Hollandaise may be varied at will;
for instance, the number of yolks may be increased if a very
thick sauce is desired, and it may be lessened in the reverse
case. Also similar results may be obtained by cooking the eggs
either more or less. As a rule, if a thick sauce be required, the
yolks ought to be well cooked and the sauce kept almost cold
in the making. Experience alone—the fruit of long practice—can
teach the various devices which enable the skilled worker
to obtain different results from the same kind and quality of
material.</p>

<h3 class="subhead" title="The Small Brown Sauces">The Small Brown Sauces</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="31—Sauce Bigarrade"><a id="rcp.31"
 >31—SAUCE BIGARRADE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce is principally used to accompany braised and
<a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a> ducklings. In the first case, the duckling’s braising
stock, being thickened, constitutes a sauce. In the second case,
the stock is clear, and the procedure in both cases is as
<span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>1. After having strained the braising sauce, completely
remove its grease, and reduce it until it is very dense. Strain it
once more through muslin, twisting the latter; then, in order to
bring the sauce to its normal consistence, add the juice of six
oranges and one lemon per quart of sauce. Finish with a small
piece of lemon and orange rind cut regularly and finely, <a href="#g_julienne">Julienne-fashion</a>,
and scalded for five minutes.</p>

<p>2. Strain the <a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a> stock, for ducklings or wild ducks,
through linen; entirely remove the grease, and add four pieces
of caramel sugar dissolved in one tablespoonful of vinegar per
one-half point of stock, the juice of the oranges and the lemon
and the <a href="#g_julienne">Julienne</a> of rinds, as for the braised-ducklings sauce
indicated above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="32—Sauce Bordelaise"><a id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.32"
 >32—SAUCE BORDELAISE</a></h3>

<p>Put into a vegetable-pan two oz. of very finely minced
shallots, one-half pint of good red wine, a pinch of mignonette
pepper, and bits of thyme and bay. Reduce the wine by
three-quarters, and add one-half pint of half-glaze. Keep the
sauce simmering for half an hour; despumate it from time to
time, and strain it through linen or a sieve. When dishing it
up, finish it with two tablespoonfuls of dissolved meat glaze, a
few drops of lemon-juice, and four oz. of beef-marrow, cut into
slices or cubes and poached in slightly salted boiling water.
This sauce may be buttered to the extent of about three oz. per
pint, which makes it smoother, but less clear. It is especially
suitable for grilled butcher’s meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="33—Chasseur Sauce (Escoffier’s Method)"><a id="rcp.33"
 >33—CHASSEUR SAUCE (Escoffier’s Method)</a></h3>

<p>Peel and mince six medium-sized mushrooms. Heat one-half oz. of butter and as much olive oil in a vegetable-pan; put
in the mushrooms, and fry the latter quickly until they are
slightly browned. Now add a coffeespoonful of minced
shallots, and immediately remove half the butter; pour one-half
pint of white wine and one glass of liqueur brandy into the
stewpan; reduce this liquid to half, and finish the sauce with:
one-half pint of half-glaze, one-quarter pint of tomato sauce, and
one tablespoonful of meat-glaze. Set to boil for five minutes
more, and complete with a teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="34—Brown Chaud-froid Sauce"><a id="rcp.34"
 >34—BROWN CHAUD-FROID SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put one quart of half-glaze into a sauté-pan with one-fifth
pint of truffle essence. Put the pan on an open fire, and reduce
its contents; while making same add to the sauce, in small
quantities at a time, one and one-half pints of jelly.</p>

<p>The degree of reduction in this sauce is a good third, but,
to be quite certain, a test of its consistence may be made by
allowing it to cool a little. After the reduction, carefully taste,
and rectify the seasoning if necessary; mix a little Madeira or
Port with the sauce, away from the fire, and strain through
muslin or, preferably, through a Venetian-hair sieve. Stir the
sauce now and then while it cools, until it is sufficiently liquid,
and at the same time consistent enough, to coat immersed solids
evenly with a film of sauce. Its use will be explained among
the formulæ of the different kinds of Chaud-froids.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="35—Varieties of the Chaud-froid Sauce"><a id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.35"
 >35—VARIETIES OF THE CHAUD-FROID SAUCE</a></h3>

<p><i>For Ducks.</i>—Prepare the sauce as above, adding to it (for
the prescribed quantity) one-half pint of duck <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> obtained
from the carcases and remains of roast duckling, and finish it,
away from the fire, with the juice of four oranges and a heaped
tablespoonful of orange rind, cut finely, <a href="#g_julienne">Julienne-fashion</a>, and
scalded for five minutes.</p>

<p><i>For Feathered Game.</i>—Treat the Chaud-Froid sauce as indicated
in No. <a href="#rcp.34">34</a>, adding one-half pint of the <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> of the
game constituting the dish in order to lend it that game’s
characteristic taste. Observe the same precaution for the cooling.</p>

<p><i>For Fish.</i>—Proceed as in No. <a href="#rcp.34">34</a>, but (1) substitute the
Espagnole of fish for the half glaze; (2) intensify the first Espagnole
with one-half pint of very clear fish essence; (3) use
Lenten jelly instead of meat jelly.</p>

<p><i>Remarks upon the Use of Chaud-Froid Sauces.</i>—The chaud-froid
sauce may be prepared beforehand, and when it is wanted
it need only be gently melted without heating it too much.
It ought simply to be made sufficiently liquid to give a good
coating to substances immersed in it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="36—Devilled Sauce"><a id="rcp.36"
 >36—DEVILLED SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put in a vegetable pan two oz. of sliced shallots and one-third
pint of white wine. Reduce the latter to two-thirds, add
one-half pint of half-glaze, reduce to two-thirds, season strongly
with cayenne pepper, and strain through muslin. This sauce
may be served with grilled fowls or pigeons. It also forms an
excellent accompaniment to re-dished meat which needs a spicy
sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="37—“Escoffier” Devilled Sauce"><a id="rcp.37"
 >37—“ESCOFFIER” DEVILLED SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce, which may be bought ready-made, is admirably
fitted to accompany grilled fish and grills in general. In order
to make it ready, all that is needed is to add its own volume
of fresh butter to it, the latter being previously well softened
so as to ensure its perfect mixture with the sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="38—Genevoise Sauce"><a id="rcp.38"
 >38—GENEVOISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Heat two oz. of butter in a stewpan; insert one lb. of Mirepoix
(No. <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>) without bacon. Slightly brown, add two lbs. of
head of salmon and remains or bones of fish, and stew with
lid on for twenty minutes. Let the stewpan lean slightly to
<a id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>one side, so that the butter may be drained; moisten with one
bottle of excellent red wine; reduce the latter by half; add one
pint of Lenten Espagnole, and allow to cook gently for half an
hour.</p>

<p>Rub the sauce through a sieve, pressing it so as to extract
all the essence. Let it rest awhile; carefully remove the fat
which has risen to the surface, and add one liqueur-glass of
burnt brandy, one-half pint of red wine, and as much fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. Boil again, then move stewpan to the side of
fire to despumate for one and one-half hours. Frequently remove
what the ebullition causes to rise to the surface, this
second period of cooking being only to ensure the purification
of the sauce. If the ebullition has been well effected, the sauce
should reach the proper degree of reduction and despumation
at the same moment of time. It is then strained through muslin
or tammy, and it is finished at the last minute with a few drops
of anchovy essence and four oz. of butter per quart of sauce.</p>

<p>N.B.—The Genevoise Sauce, like all red-wine sauces, may
be served without being buttered. It is thus clearer and more
sightly in colour, but the addition of butter in small quantities
makes it mellower and more palatable.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="38a—Remarks On Red-wine Sauces"><a id="rcp.38a"
 >38a—REMARKS ON RED-WINE SAUCES</a></h3>

<p>In the general repertory of cooking we also have, in the
way of red-wine sauces, the “Bourguignonne,” “Matelote,”
and “Red-Wine” sauces, which are closely allied to the
“Genevoise,” and only differ from it in details of procedure.</p>

<p>The “Bourguignonne” Sauce is composed of red-wine
accompanied by aromatics, and reduced by half. In accordance
with ordinary principles, it is thickened by means of
three oz. of <a href="#g_manied">manied</a> butter per quart of reduced wine. This
sauce is buttered with four oz. of butter per quart, and is especially
regarded as a domestic preparation for poached, moulded,
and hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>“Matelote” Sauce is made from Court-bouillon, with red
wine which has been used for cooking fish. This Court-bouillon,
with the mushroom parings added, is reduced by
two-thirds, and is thickened with one pint of Lenten Espagnole
per pint of the reduced Court-bouillon.</p>

<p>This sauce should be reduced by a third, strained through
a tammy, and finished by means of two oz. of butter and a
little cayenne per pint of sauce.</p>

<p>The Red-Wine Sauce resembles the two preceding ones in
so far as it contains <a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a> browned in butter and diluted
<a id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with red wine. The wine is reduced by half, thickened by a
pint of Lenten Espagnole per pint of the reduction, and the
sauce is despumated for about twenty minutes. It is strained
through a tammy, and finished, when ready, by a few drops
of anchovy essence, a little cayenne, and two oz. of butter per
pint of sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="39—Grand-Veneur Sauce"><a id="rcp.39"
 >39—GRAND-VENEUR SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take one pint of Poivrade Sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.49">49</a>) and boil it, adding
one pint of game stock to keep it light; reduce the sauce by a
good third; remove it from the fire, and add four tablespoonfuls
of red-currant jelly. When the latter is well dissolved, complete
the sauce by one-quarter pint of cream per pint of sauce.</p>

<p>This sauce is the proper accompaniment for joints of
venison.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="40—Italian Sauce"><a id="rcp.40"
 >40—ITALIAN SAUCE</a></h3>

<p><i>Ordinary Italian Sauce.</i>—Put into a stewpan six tablespoonfuls
of Duxelles (see No. <a href="#rcp.223">223</a>), two oz. of very lean, cooked
ham, cut very finely, <a href="#g_brunoise">brunoise-fashion</a>, and one pint of half-glaze
tomatée. Boil for ten minutes, and complete, at the
moment of dishing up, with one teaspoonful of parsley, chervil,
and tarragon, minced and mixed.</p>

<p><i>Lenten Italian Sauce.</i>—Same preparation, only (1) omit the
Ham, and (2) substitute Lent Espagnole (combined with fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> made from the fish for which the sauce is intended) for
half glaze with tomatoes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="41—Thickened Gravy"><a id="rcp.41"
 >41—THICKENED GRAVY</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of poultry or veal stock (according to the
nature of the dish the gravy is intended for). Thicken this
sauce by means of three-quarters oz. of fecula, diluted cold,
with a little water or gravy, and pour this leason into the
boiling gravy, being careful to stir briskly.</p>

<p>The thickened gravy with the veal-stock base is used for
choicest pieces of butcher’s meat; that with a poultry-stock
base is for fillets of poultry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="42—Veal Gravy Tomaté"><a id="rcp.42"
 >42—VEAL GRAVY TOMATÉ</a></h3>

<p>Add to one pint of veal stock two oz. of purée and one-quarter
pint of tomato juice, and reduce by a fifth. Strain the
gravy through linen. This gravy is for butcher’s meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="43—Lyonnaise Sauce"><a id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Finely mince two oz. of onions and brown them slightly in
two oz. of butter. Moisten with one-quarter pint of white wine
and as much vinegar; almost entirely reduce the liquid; add
one and one-half pints of clear half-glaze, and set to cook slowly
for half an hour. Rub the sauce through a tammy.</p>

<p>N.B.—The onion may be left in the sauce or not, according

consumer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="44—Madeira Sauce"><a id="rcp.44"
 >44—MADEIRA SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put one and one-half pints of half-glaze into a sauté-pan, and
reduce it on a brisk fire to a stiff consistence. When it reaches
this point, take it off the fire and add one-fifth pint of Madeira
to it, which brings it back to its normal consistence. Strain
through a tammy, and keep it warm without allowing it to
boil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="45—Marrow Sauce"><a id="rcp.45"
 >45—MARROW SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Follow the proportions as indicated under “Sauce Bordelaise”
(No. <a href="#rcp.32">32</a>) for the necessary quantity of this sauce, the
Marrow Sauce being only a variety of the Bordelaise. Finish
it with six oz. per quart of beef marrow, cut into cubes, poached
and well drained, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley,
scalded for a second. If the sauce is to accompany vegetables,
finish it, away from the fire, with three oz. of butter, and then
add the cubes of marrow and the parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="46—Pignons Sauce"><a id="rcp.46"
 >46—PIGNONS SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take the necessary amount of Poivrade Sauce prepared
according to Formula No. <a href="#rcp.49">49</a>, and let it boil. Now, for one
pint of sauce, prepare an infusion of juniper berries, with one-quarter
pint of water and two oz. of <a href="#g_concass">concassed</a> berries; one oz.
of grilled fir-apple kernels, and one oz. of raisins, stoned and
washed, and left to soak in tepid water for about an hour.
Finish the sauce, when dishing up, by adding the infusion
of juniper berries strained through linen, the grilled kernels,
the soaked raisins, and one-eighth pint of Madeira wine.</p>

<p>This sauce is specially suited to joints of venison.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="47—Périgueux Sauce"><a id="rcp.47"
 >47—PÉRIGUEUX<!-- TN: acute invisible --> SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a “Sauce Madère” as explained in No. <a href="#rcp.44">44</a>, and add
to the half-glaze, to be reduced, half its volume of very strong
veal stock, and keep it a little denser than usual. Finish this
<a id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sauce by adding one-sixth pint of truffle essence and three oz.
of chopped truffles per quart of Madeira Sauce. It is used for
numerous small entrées, timbales, hot pâtés, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="48—Piquante Sauce"><a id="rcp.48"
 >48—PIQUANTE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put into a vegetable pan two oz. of minced shallots, one-quarter
pint of vinegar, and as much white wine. Reduce the
liquid by a good half, and add one pint of half-glaze; set the
sauce to boil, and despumate it for half an hour. At the last
moment finish it, away from the fire, with two oz. of gherkins,
one oz. of capers, and a teaspoonful of chervil, parsley, and
tarragon, mixed; all the ingredients to be finely chopped. This
sauce generally accompanies grilled or boiled pork, and cold
meat re-dished and minced which needs spicy flavouring.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="49—Ordinary Poivrade Sauce"><a id="rcp.49"
 >49—ORDINARY POIVRADE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>1. Heat two oz. of butter in a stewpan, and insert one lb. of
raw Mirepoix (No. <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>). Fry the vegetables until they are well
browned; moisten with one-quarter pint of vinegar and one-half
pint of <a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a> (Formula <a href="#rcp.169">169</a>); reduce to two-thirds; add one
pint of Espagnole Sauce, and cook for three-quarters of an
hour. Ten minutes before straining the sauce, put in a few
crushed peppercorns. If the pepper were put in the sauce
earlier, it might make it bitter.</p>

<p>2. Pass the sauce through a strainer, pressing the aromatics;
add a further one-half pint of <a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a>, and despumate for
one-quarter of an hour, keeping it simmering the while. Strain
again through tammy, and finish the sauce, when ready for
dishing, with two oz. of butter.</p>

<p>This sauce is suitable for joints <a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a> or not.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="50—Poivrade Sauce For Venison"><a id="rcp.50"
 >50—POIVRADE SAUCE FOR VENISON</a></h3>

<p>Fry, with two oz. of butter and two oz. of oil, one lb. of
raw Mirepoix (No. <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>) to which are added four lbs. of well-broken
bones and ground-game trimmings. When the whole
is well browned, drain the grease away, and dilute with one
pint of vinegar and one pint of white wine. Reduce this liquid
by three-quarters, then add three quarts of game stock and a
quart of Espagnole Sauce. Boil, cover the saucepan, and put
into a moderate oven, where it should stay for at least three
hours. At the end of this time take out the saucepan and pour
its contents into a fine sieve placed over a tureen; press the
remains so as to expel all the sauce they hold, and pour the
<a id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sauce into a tall, thick saucepan. Add enough game stock and
<a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a>, mixed in equal parts, to produce three quarts in all
of sauce, and gently reduce the latter while despumating it.
As it diminishes in volume, it should be passed through muslin
into smaller saucepans, and the reduction should be stopped
when only a quart of sauce remains.</p>

<p>N.B.—This sauce, like red-wine sauces, may be served as it
stands. It is brilliant, clear, and perhaps more sightly thus,
but the addition of a certain quantity of butter (four oz. per
quart) makes it perfectly mellow, and admirably completes its
fragrance.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="51—Provençale Sauce"><a id="rcp.51"
 >51—PROVENÇALE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Peel, remove the seeds, press and <a href="#g_concass">concass</a> twelve medium
tomatoes. Heat in a sauté-pan one-fifth pint of oil, until it
begins to smoke a little; insert the tomatoes seasoned with
pepper and salt; add a crushed garlic clove, a pinch of powdered
sugar, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and allow to melt
gently for half an hour. In reality, true Provençale is nothing
but a fine <a href="#g_fondue">fondue</a> of tomatoes with garlic.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="52—Robert Sauce"><a id="rcp.52"
 >52—ROBERT SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Finely mince a large onion and put it into a stewpan with
butter. Fry the onion gently and without letting it acquire any
colour. Dilute with one-third pint of white wine, reduce the
latter by one-third, add one pint of half-glaze, and leave to
simmer for twenty minutes. When dishing up, finish the sauce
with one tablespoonful of meat glaze, one teaspoonful of
mustard, and one pinch of powdered sugar. If, when finished,
the sauce has to wait, it should be kept warm in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, as
it must not boil again. This sauce—of a spicy flavour—is best
suited to grilled and boiled pork. It may also be used for a
mince of the same meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="53—Escoffier Roberts Sauce"><a id="rcp.53"
 >53—ESCOFFIER ROBERTS SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce may be bought ready-made. It is used either hot
or cold. It is especially suitable for pork, veal, poultry, and
even fish, and is generally used hot with grills after the equivalent
of its volume of excellent brown stock has been added
to it. It may also be served cold to accompany cold meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="54—Rouennaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.54"
 >54—ROUENNAISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a “Bordelaise” sauce according to Formula No. <a href="#rcp.32">32</a>. The diluent of this sauce must be an excellent red wine.
For one pint of sauce, pass four raw ducks’ livers through a
<a id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sieve; add the resulting purée to the Bordelaise, and heat the
latter for a few minutes in order to poach the liver. Be careful,
however, not to heat the sauce too much nor too long, lest the
liver be cooked. Serve this sauce with duckling à la Rouennaise.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="55—Salmis Sauce"><a id="rcp.55"
 >55—SALMIS SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>The base of this sauce, which rather resembles the cullis, is
unchangeable. Its diluent only changes according to the kind
of birds or game to be treated, and whether this game is to be
considered ordinary or Lenten.</p>

<p>Cut and gently brown in butter five oz. of Mirepoix (Formula <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>). Add the shin detached from the limbs and the chopped
carcase of the bird under treatment, and moisten with one pint
of white wine. Reduce the latter to two-thirds, add one-half
pint of half glaze, and boil gently for three-quarters of an hour.
Pass through a strainer, while pressing upon the carcase and
the aromatics, with the view of extracting their quintessence,
and thin the cullis thus obtained by means of one-half pint of
game stock or mushroom liquor, if the game be Lenten. Now
despumate for about one hour, finally reduce the sauce, bring
it to its proper consistency with a little mushroom liquor and
truffle essence, rub it through tammy, and butter it slightly at
the last moment.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="56—Tortue Sauce"><a id="rcp.56"
 >56—TORTUE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one-half pint of veal stock, adding a small sprig of sage,
sweet marjoram, rosemary, basil, thyme, and as much bay,
two oz. of mushroom parings, and one oz. of parsley. Cover
and allow to infuse for half an hour. Two minutes before straining
the infusion, add four <a href="#g_concass">concassed</a> peppercorns.</p>

<p>After straining through fine linen, add one-half pint of half-glaze
and as much tomato sauce (away from the fire) with four
tablespoonfuls of sherry, a little truffle essence, and a good pinch
of cayenne.</p>

<p>N.B.—As this sauce must be spicy, the use of cayenne suggests
itself, but great caution should be observed, as there must
be no excess of this condiment.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="57—Venison Sauce"><a id="rcp.57"
 >57—VENISON SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a Poivrade sauce for game, as explained in No. <a href="#rcp.50">50</a>.
Finish this sauce with two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly,
previously dissolved, and mixed with five tablespoonfuls of
<a id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fresh cream per pint of sauce. This addition of cream and red-currants
must be made away from the fire.</p>

<p>Serve this sauce with big ground-game.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="58—American Sauce"><a id="rcp.58"
 >58—AMERICAN SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce is that of lobster prepared “à l’Américaine”
(see No. <a href="#rcp.939">939</a>). As it generally accompanies a fish, the meat of
the lobster or lobsters which have served in its preparation is
sliced and used as the garnish of the fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="59—Anchovy Sauce"><a id="rcp.59"
 >59—ANCHOVY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put into a small stewpan one pint of unbuttered “Normande
Sauce” (No. <a href="#rcp.99">99</a>), and finish it, away from the fire, with three oz. of anchovy butter, and one oz. of anchovy fillets, washed,
well sponged, and cut into small pieces.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="60—Aurore Sauce"><a id="rcp.60"
 >60—AURORE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Into one-half pint of boiling velouté put the same quantity
of very red tomato purée (No. <a href="#rcp.29">29</a>), and mix the two. Let the
sauce boil a little, pass it through a tammy, and finish, away
from the fire, with three oz. of butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="61—Lenten Aurore Sauce"><a id="rcp.61"
 >61—LENTEN AURORE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce is made like the preceding one, <i>i.e.</i>, with the
same quantities of velouté and tomato purée, replacing ordinary
velouté by fish velouté.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="62—Béarnaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.62"
 >62—BÉARNAISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put into a small stewpan one teaspoonful of chopped shallots,
two oz. of chopped tarragon stalks, three oz. of chervil, some
mignonette pepper, a pinch of salt, and four tablespoonfuls of
vinegar. Reduce the vinegar by two-thirds, take off the fire,
let the stewpan cool a little, and add to this reduction the yolks
of five eggs. Now put the stewpan on a low fire and gradually
combine with the yolks six oz. of melted butter. Whisk the
sauce briskly, so as to ensure the cooking of the yolks, which
alone, by gradual cooking, effect the leason of the sauce.</p>

<p>When the butter is combined with the sauce, rub the latter
through tammy, and finish it with a teaspoonful of chervil
parings and chopped tarragon leaves. Complete the seasoning
with a suspicion of cayenne. This sauce should not be served
very hot, as it is really a mayonnaise with butter. It need only
<a id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be tepid, for it would probably turn if it were over-heated.
Serve it with grilled, butcher’s meat and poultry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="63—Béarnaise Sauce with Meat Glaze, otherwise Valois Sauce or Foyot Sauce"><a id="rcp.63"
 >63—BÉARNAISE SAUCE WITH MEAT GLAZE, <span class="nw">OTHERWISE VALOIS</span> SAUCE OR FOYOT SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a Béarnaise sauce as explained in No. <a href="#rcp.62">62</a>. Complete
it with three tablespoonfuls of dissolved pale meat glaze, which
may be added in small quantities at a time. Serve it with
butcher’s meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="64—Béarnaise Tomatée Sauce or Choron Sauce"><a id="rcp.64"
 >64—BÉARNAISE TOMATÉE SAUCE OR CHORON SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Proceed in exactly the same way as for Béarnaise No. <a href="#rcp.62">62</a>.
When the sauce is made and rubbed through tammy, finish it
with one-third pint of very red tomato purée. In this case the
final addition of chervil and tarragon should not be made.</p>

<p>This is proper to “Tournedos Choron,” but it may accompany
grilled poultry and white, butcher’s meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="65—Bercy Sauce"><a id="rcp.65"
 >65—BERCY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Heat two oz. of chopped shallots. Moisten with one-half
pint of white wine and as much fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, or, when possible,
the same quantity of fish liquor, the latter being, of course,
that of a fish similar to the one the sauce is to accompany.
Reduce to a good third, add one-third pint of velouté, let the
sauce boil some time, and finish it, away from the fire, with
four oz. of butter (added by degrees), a few drops of fish glaze,
half the juice of a lemon, and one oz. of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Serve with medium-sized poached fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="66—Butter Sauce"><a id="rcp.66"
 >66—BUTTER SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Mix two oz. of sifted flour with two oz. of melted butter.
Dilute with one quart of boiling water, salted to the extent of
one-quarter oz. per quart. Stir briskly to ensure a perfect
leason, and do not allow to boil. Add immediately the yolks
of six eggs mixed with one-quarter pint of cream and the juice
of half a lemon. Rub through a tammy, and finish the sauce
with five oz. of best fresh butter.</p>

<p>Be careful that the sauce does not boil after it has been
thickened.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="67—Bonnefoy Sauce, or White Bordelaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.67"
 >67—BONNEFOY SAUCE, OR WHITE BORDELAISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put in a stewpan two oz. of minced shallots and one-half
pint of Graves, Sauterne, or any other excellent white
<a id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Bordeaux. Reduce the wine almost entirely, add one-quarter pint
of velouté, let it simmer twenty minutes, and rub it through a
tammy. Finish it, away from the fire, with six oz. of butter
and a little chopped tarragon.</p>

<p>Serve it with grilled fish and grilled white meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="68—Caper Sauce"><a id="rcp.68"
 >68—CAPER SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This is a derivative of the Butter Sauce described under No. <a href="#rcp.66">66</a>, and there need only be added two tablespoonfuls of capers
per pint of sauce. It frequently accompanies boiled fish of all
kinds.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="69—Cardinal Sauce"><a id="rcp.69"
 >69—CARDINAL SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of Béchamel, to which add one-half pint of fish
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> and a little truffle essence, and reduce by a quarter.
Finish the sauce, when dishing up, with three tablespoonfuls of
cream and three oz. of very red lobster butter (No. <a href="#rcp.149">149</a>).</p>

<p>This sauce is poured over the fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="70—Mushroom Sauce"><a id="rcp.70"
 >70—MUSHROOM SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>If this be intended for poultry, add one-fifth pint of mushroom
liquor and eight oz. of button-mushroom heads turned
or channelled and cooked, to one pint of very stiff Allemande
Sauce.</p>

<p>If it be intended for fish, take one pint of fish velouté,
thickened with the yolks of four eggs, and finish it with mushroom
liquor, as above.</p>

<p>The sauce that I suggest for poultry may also be used for
fish, after adding the necessary quantity of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="71—Châteaubriand Sauce"><a id="rcp.71"
 >71—CHÂTEAUBRIAND SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put one oz. of chopped shallots, a sprig of thyme and a bit
of bay, one oz. of mushroom parings, and one-quarter pint of
white wine into a stewpan. Reduce the wine almost entirely,
add one-half pint of veal gravy, and reduce again until the
liquid only measures one-quarter pint. Strain through muslin,
and finish the sauce away from the fire with four oz. of butter
“Maître d’Hôtel<!-- TN: circumflex invisible -->” (No. <a href="#rcp.150">150</a>), to which may be added a little
chopped tarragon. Serve with grilled fillet of beef, otherwise
“Châteaubriand.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="72—White Chaud-Froid Sauce"><a id="rcp.72"
 >72—WHITE CHAUD-FROID SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of velouté in a stewpan, and add three-quarters
pint of melted white poultry jelly. Put the stewpan on an open
<a id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fire, reduce the sauce by a third, stirring constantly the while,
and gradually add one-half pint of very fresh cream. When
the sauce has reached the desired degree of consistency rub it
through a tammy, and stir it frequently while it cools, for fear
of a skin forming on its surface, for if this happened it would
have to be strained again. When dishing up, this sauce should
be cold, so that it may properly coat immersed solids and yet
be liquid enough to admit of the latter being easily steeped
into it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="73—Ordinary Chaud-Froid Sauce"><a id="rcp.73"
 >73—ORDINARY CHAUD-FROID SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as above, substituting Allemande Sauce for
the velouté, and reducing the quantity of cream to one-quarter
pint. Observe the same precautions while cooling.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="74—Chaud-Froid Sauce, à l’Aurore"><a id="rcp.74"
 >74—CHAUD-FROID SAUCE, A L’AURORE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a white Chaud-Froid (No. <a href="#rcp.72">72</a>). The same may be
coloured by the addition of fine red tomato purée—more or
less to match the desired shade—or by an infusion of paprika,
according to the use for which it is intended. This last product
is preferable when not too deep a shade is required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="75—Chaud-Froid Sauce, au Vert-pré"><a id="rcp.75"
 >75—CHAUD-FROID SAUCE, AU VERT-PRÉ</a></h3>

<p>Add to the velouté of the white Chaud-Froid sauce, at the
same time as the jelly, an infusion prepared <span class="nw">thus:—</span>Boil one-quarter
pint of white wine, and add to it one pinch of chervil
stalks, a similar quantity of tarragon leaves, chives, and parsley
leaves. Cover, allow infusion to proceed away from the fire
for ten minutes, and strain through linen.</p>

<p>Treat the sauce as explained, and finish with spinach-green
(No. <a href="#rcp.143">143</a>). The shade of the sauce must not be too pronounced,
but must remain a pale green. The colouring principle must
therefore be added with caution and in small quantities, until
the correct shade is obtained. Use this sauce for Chaud-froids
of fowl, particularly that kind distinguished as “<a href="#g_printanier"><i>Printanier</i></a>.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="76—Lent Chaud-Froid Sauce"><a id="rcp.76"
 >76—LENT CHAUD-FROID SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as for white Chaud-Froid, using the same quantities,
and taking note of the following <span class="nw">modifications:—</span></p>

<p>1. Substitute fish velouté for ordinary velouté.</p>

<p>2. Substitute white fish jelly for poultry jelly.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—I have adopted the use of this ordinary Chaud-Froid
sauce for the glazing of fillets and escalopes of fish and
Shell-fish, instead of cleared Mayonnaise, formerly used, which
<a id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had certain inconveniences—not the least being the oozing away
of the oil under the shrinkage of the gelatine. This difficulty
does not obtain in the ordinary Chaud-Froid, the definite and
pronounced flavour of which is better than that of the cleared
Mayonnaise.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="77—“Escoffier” Cherry Sauce"><a id="rcp.77"
 >77—“ESCOFFIER” CHERRY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>This sauce may be bought ready-made. Like the Roberts
Sauce, it can be served hot or cold. It is an excellent adjunct
to venison, and even to small ground-game. Saddle of venison
with this sauce constitutes one of the greatest dainties that an
epicure could desire.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="78—Chivry Sauce"><a id="rcp.78"
 >78—CHIVRY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>In one-half pint of boiling poultry stock put a large pinch of
chervil <a href="#g_pluches">pluches</a>, tarragon and parsley leaves, a head of young
pimpernel (the qualification here is very important, for this
aromatic plant grows bitter as it matures), and a good pinch of
chives. Cover up, and let infusion proceed for ten to twelve
minutes; then add the liquid (strained through linen) to one pint
of velouté. Boil, reduce by a quarter, and complete it with
two oz. of Green Butter (No. <a href="#rcp.143">143</a>). Chivry Sauce is admirably
suited to boiled or poached poultry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="79—Cream Sauce"><a id="rcp.79"
 >79—CREAM SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of Béchamel Sauce, and add one-quarter pint of
cream to it. Reduce on an open fire until the sauce has become
very thick; then pass through tammy. Bring to its normal
degree of consistency by gradually adding, away from the fire,
one-quarter pint of very fresh cream and a few drops of lemon-juice.
Serve this sauce with boiled fish, poultry, eggs, and
various vegetables.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="80—Shrimp Sauce"><a id="rcp.80"
 >80—SHRIMP SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of fish velouté or, failing this, Béchamel sauce,
and add to it one-quarter pint of cream and one-quarter pint
of very clear fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. Reduce to one pint, and finish
the sauce, away from the fire, with two oz. of Shrimp Butter
(No. <a href="#rcp.145">145</a>) and two oz. of shelled shrimps’ tails.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="81—Curry Sauce"><a id="rcp.81"

<p>Slightly brown the following vegetables in <span class="nw">butter:—</span>Twelve oz. of minced onions, one oz. of parsley roots, four oz. of minced

Boil, cook gently for three-quarters of an hour, and rub through
a tammy. Now heat the sauce, remove its grease, and keep it
in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>. Serve this sauce with fish, shell-fish, poultry,

<h3 class="recipe" title="84—Gooseberry Sauce"><a id="rcp.84"
 >84—GOOSEBERRY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare one pint of butter sauce, Formula No. <a href="#rcp.66">66</a>. Meanwhile
put one lb. of green gooseberries into a small copper
saucepan containing boiling water. Boil for five minutes, then
drain the gooseberries, and put them in a little stewpan with
one-half pint of white wine and three oz. of powdered sugar.
Gently cook the gooseberries, rub them through a tammy, and
add the resulting pulp to the butter sauce. This sauce is excellent
with grilled mackerel and the poached fillets of that fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="85—Hungarian Sauce"><a id="rcp.85"
 >85—HUNGARIAN SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Gently fry in butter, without colouring, two tablespoonfuls
of chopped onions seasoned with table-salt and half a teaspoonful
of paprika. Moisten with one-quarter pint of white wine,
add a small faggot, reduce the wine by two-thirds, and remove
the herbs.</p>

<p>Finish with one pint of ordinary or Lenten Velouté, according
to the use for which the sauce is intended, and boil moderately
for five minutes. Then rub the sauce through a tammy,
and complete it with two oz. of butter. Remember this sauce
should be of a tender, pink shade, which it must owe to the
paprika alone.</p>

<p><a id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span

<h3 class="recipe" title="87—Ivory Sauce, or Albufera Sauce"><a id="rcp.87"
 >87—IVORY SAUCE, OR ALBUFERA SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take the necessary quantity of Suprême Sauce, prepared
as explained in No. <a href="#rcp.106a">106a</a>. Add to this four tablespoonfuls of
dissolved, pale, meat glaze per quart of sauce, in order to lend
the latter that ivory-white tint which characterises it. Serve
this sauce chiefly with poultry and poached sweet-bread.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="88—Joinville Sauce"><a id="rcp.88"
 >88—JOINVILLE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare one pint of Normande Sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.99">99</a>), as given in
the first part of its formula, and complete it with two oz. of
shrimp butter and two oz. of crayfish butter. If this sauce is
to accompany a fish à la Joinville, which includes a special
garnish, it is served as it stands. If it is served with a large,
boiled, ungarnished fish, one oz. of very black truffles cut
<i><a href="#g_julienne">Julienne-fashion</a></i> should be added. As may be seen, Joinville
Sauce differs from similar preparations in the final operation
where crayfish and shrimp butter are combined.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="89—Maltese Sauce"><a id="rcp.89"
 >89—MALTESE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>To the Hollandaise Sauce, given under No. <a href="#rcp.30">30</a>, add, when<!-- TN: original includes comma -->
dishing up, the juice of two blood oranges (these late-season
oranges being especially suitable for this sauce) and half a
coffeespoonful of grated orange-rind.</p>

<p>Maltese Sauce is the finest for asparagus.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="90—Marinière Sauce"><a id="rcp.90"
 >90—MARINIÈRE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take the necessary quantity of Bercy Sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.65">65</a>), and
add, per pint of sauce, one-quarter pint of mussel liquor and a
leason composed of the yolks of three eggs.</p>

<p>Serve this with small poached fish and more particularly with
mussels.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="91—Mornay Sauce"><a id="rcp.91"
 >91—MORNAY SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of Béchamel Sauce with one-quarter pint of
the <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> of the fish, poultry, or vegetable, which is to constitute
<a id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>the dish. Reduce by a good quarter, and add two oz. of Gruyère
and two oz. of grated Parmesan.</p>

<p>Put the sauce on the fire again for a few minutes, and ensure
the melting of the cheese by stirring with a small whisk. Finish
the sauce away from the fire with two oz. of butter added by
degrees.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="92—Mousseline Sauce"><a id="rcp.92"
 >92—MOUSSELINE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>To a Hollandaise Sauce, prepared as explained (No. <a href="#rcp.30">30</a>), add,
just before dishing up, one-half pint of stiffly-whipped cream
per pint of sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="93—Mousseuse Sauce"><a id="rcp.93"
 >93—MOUSSEUSE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Scald and wipe a small vegetable-pan, and put into it one-half lb. of stiffly-<i><a href="#g_manied">manied</a></i> butter, properly softened. Season this
butter with table-salt and a few drops of lemon-juice, and whisk
it while gradually adding one-third pint of cold water. Finish
with two tablespoonfuls of very firm, whipped cream. This preparation,
though classified as a sauce, is really a compound
butter, which is served with boiled fish. The heat of the fish
alone suffices to melt it, and its appearance is infinitely more
agreeable than that of plain, melted butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="94—Mustard Sauce"><a id="rcp.94"
 >94—MUSTARD SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take the necessary quantity of butter sauce and complete it,
away from the fire, with one tablespoonful of mustard per pint
of sauce.</p>

<p>N.B.—If the sauce has to wait, it must be kept in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>,
for it should not on any account boil. It is served with
certain small grilled fish, especially fresh herrings.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="95—Nantua Sauce"><a id="rcp.95"
 >95—NANTUA SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of Béchamel Sauce, add one-half pint of cream,
and reduce by a third. Rub it through a tammy, and finish it
with a further addition of two tablespoonfuls of cream, three oz.
of very fine crayfish butter, and one tablespoonful of small,
shelled crayfishes’ tails.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="96—Newburg Sauce"><a id="rcp.96"
 >96—NEWBURG SAUCE</a></h3>

<p><i>First Method</i> (<i>with Raw Lobsters</i>).—Divide a two lb. lobster
into four parts. Remove its creamy parts, pound them finely
with two oz. of butter, and put them aside.</p>

<p><a id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Heat in a sautépan one and one-half oz. of butter and as
much oil, and insert the pieces of lobster, well seasoned with
salt and cayenne. Fry until the pieces assume a fine, red colour;
entirely drain away the butter, and add two tablespoonfuls of
burnt brandy and one-third pint of Marsala or old Sherry.</p>

<p>Reduce the wine by two-thirds, and wet the lobster with one-third
pint of cream and one-half pint of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->. Now add
a faggot, cover the sautépan, and gently cook for twenty-five
minutes. Then drain the lobster on a sieve, remove
the meat and cut it into cubes, and finish the sauce by adding
the creamy portions put aside from the first. Boil so as to
ensure the cooking of these latter portions; add the meat, cut
into cubes, and verify the seasoning.</p>

<p>N.B.—The addition of the meat to the sauce is optional;
instead of cutting it into cubes it may be stewed and displayed
on the fish constituting the dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="97—Second Method (with Cooked Lobster)"><a id="rcp.97"
 >97—SECOND METHOD (WITH COOKED LOBSTER)</a></h3>

<p>The lobster having been cooked in a <i>Court-bouillon</i>, shell
the tail and slice it up. Arrange these slices in a sautépan liberally
buttered at the bottom; season them strongly with salt and
cayenne, and heat them on both sides so as to effect the reddening
of the skin. Immerse, so as to cover, in a good Sherry,
and almost entirely reduce same.</p>

<p>When dishing up, pour on to the slices a leason composed
of one-third pint of fresh cream and the yolks of two eggs.
Gently stir, away from the fire, and roll the saucepan about until
the leason is completed.</p>

<p>Originally, these two sauces, like the American, were exclusively
composed of, and served with, lobster. They were
one with the two very excellent preparations of lobster which
bear their name. In its two forms lobster may only be served
at lunch, many people with delicate stomachs being unable to
digest it at night. To obviate this serious difficulty, I have
made it a practice to serve lobster sauce with fillets or <a href="#g_mousseline">Mousselines</a>
of sole, adding the lobster as a garnish only. And this
innovation proved most welcome to the public.</p>

<p>By using such condiments as curry and paprika, excellent
varieties of this sauce may be obtained, which are particularly
suited to sole and other white Lenten fish. In either of these
cases it is well to add a little rice “à l’Indienne” to the fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="98—Noisette Sauce"><a id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Serve this with salmon, trout, and all boiled fish in general.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="99—Normande Sauce"><a id="rcp.99"

<p>Put in a sautépan one pint of fish velouté, three tablespoonfuls
of mushroom liquor, as much oyster liquor, and twice as
much sole <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, the yolks of three eggs, a few drops of lemon-juice,
and one-quarter pint of cream. Reduce by a good third
on an open fire, season with a little cayenne, rub through a
tammy, and finish with two oz. of butter and four tablespoonfuls
of good cream.</p>

<p>This sauce is proper to fillet of sole “à la Normande,” but
it is also frequently used as the base of other small sauces.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="100—Oriental Sauce"><a id="rcp.100"
 >100—ORIENTAL SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Take one pint of American sauce, season with curry, and

<p>Boil for a few minutes one pint of Sauce Allemande, and
add six tablespoonfuls of mushroom liquor. Finish, away from

one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Use this sauce with
certain vegetables, but more generally with sheep’s trotters.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="102—Ravigote Sauce"><a id="rcp.102"
 >102—RAVIGOTE<!-- TN: original reads "RAVIGOTTE" --> SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Reduce by half, one-quarter pint of white wine with half

<h3 class="recipe" title="104—Soubise Sauce"><a id="rcp.104"
 >104—SOUBISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Stew in butter two lbs. of finely-minced onions, scalded for
three minutes and well dried. This stewing of the onions in
butter increases their flavour. Now add one-half pint of thickened
Béchamel; season with salt and a teaspoonful of powdered
sugar. Cook gently for half an hour, rub through a tammy,
and complete the sauce with some tablespoonfuls of cream and
two oz. of butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="105—Soubise Sauce with Rice"><a id="rcp.105"
 >105—SOUBISE SAUCE WITH RICE</a></h3>

<p>The same quantity as above of minced onions, scalded and
well drained. Garnish the bottom and the sides of a tall,
medium stewpan with some thin rashers of fat bacon. Insert
the onions, together with one-quarter lb. of Carolina rice, one
pint of white consommé, a large pinch of powdered sugar, and
the necessary salt. Cook gently in the front of the oven for
three-quarters of an hour. Then pound the onions and rice in
a mortar, rub the resulting purée through a tammy, and finish
with cream and butter as in the preceding case.</p>

<p>N.B.—This sauce, being more consistent than the former, is
used as a garnish just as often as a sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="106—Soubise Sauce Tomatée"><a id="rcp.106"
 >106—SOUBISE SAUCE TOMATÉE<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Prepare a soubise in accordance with the first of the two
above formulæ, and add to it one-third of its volume of very

<h3 class="subhead" title="">Remarks.</h3>

<p>1. The Soubise is rather a cullis than a sauce; <i>i.e.</i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->, its consistence
must be greater than that of a sauce.</p>

<p>2. The admixture of Béchamel in Soubise is preferable to
that of rice, seeing that it makes it smoother. If, in certain
cases, rice is used as a cohering element, in order to give the
Soubise more stiffness.</p>

<p>3. In accordance with the uses to which it may be put, the
Soubise Tomatée may be finally seasoned either with curry or
paprika.</p>

<p>The salient characteristics of Suprême Sauce are its perfect
whiteness and consummate delicacy. It is generally prepared
in small quantities only.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Put one and one-half pints of very clear
poultry stock and one-quarter pint of mushroom cooking liquor
into a sautépan. Reduce to two-thirds; add one pint of
“poultry velouté”; reduce on an open fire, stirring with the

with the sauce, this last ingredient being added little by little.</p>

<p>When the sauce has reached the desired consistence, strain
it through a sieve, and add another one-quarter pint of cream
and two oz. of best butter. Stir with a spoon, from time to
time, or keep the pan well covered.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="107—Venetian Sauce"><a id="rcp.107"

sauce is suitable for glazed fish.</p>

<p>2. Almost entirely reduce one-quarter pint of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. To
this reduction add the yolks of four eggs, mixing them well in
it, and follow with one lb. of butter, added by degrees, paying
heed to the precautions indicated under sauce Hollandaise No. <a href="#rcp.30">30</a>.</p>

<p>3. Put the yolks of five eggs into a small stewpan and mix
them with one tablespoonful of cold fish-stock. Put the stewpan

meanwhile adding from time to time, and in small quantities,
six tablespoonfuls of excellent fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. The procedure in this

<p>This sauce is chiefly used with cold fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="126—Mayonnaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.126"
 >126—MAYONNAISE SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Put in a basin the yolks of six raw eggs, after having
removed the cores. Season them with one-half oz. of table-salt
and a little cayenne pepper. Gradually pour one-fifth
pint of vinegar on the yolks while whisking them briskly.
When the vinegar is absorbed add one quart of oil, letting the
latter trickle down in a thread, constantly stirring the sauce
meanwhile. The sauce is finished by the addition of the juice
of a lemon and three tablespoonfuls of boiling water—the
purpose of the latter being to ensure the coherence of the
sauce and to prevent its turning.</p>

<p>Mayonnaise prepared in this way is rather liquid, but it
need only be left to rest a few hours in order to thicken considerably.
Unless it be exposed to too low a temperature, the
Mayonnaise, prepared as above, never turns, and may be kept
for several days without the fear of anything happening to it.
Merely cover it to keep the dust away.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—In the matter of that sauce there exist endless
prejudices, which I must attempt to <span class="nw">refute:—</span></p>

<p>1. If the sauce forms badly, or not at all, the reason is that
the oil has been added too rapidly at first, before the addition
of the vinegar, and that its assimilation by the yolks has not
operated normally.</p>

<p>2. It is quite an error to suppose that it is necessary to
work over ice or in a cold room. Cold is rather deleterious to
the Mayonnaise, and is invariably the cause of this sauce turning
in winter. In the cold season the oil should be slightly
<a id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>warmed, or, at least, kept at the temperature of the kitchen,
though it is best to make it in a moderately warm place.</p>

<p>3. It is a further error to suppose that the seasoning interferes
with the making of the sauce, for salt, in solution, rather
provokes the cohering force of the yolks.</p>

<p><i>Causes of the Disintegration of the</i> <span class="nw"><i>Mayonnaise</i>:—</span></p>

<p>1. The too rapid addition of the oil at the start.</p>

<p>2. The use of congealed, or too cold, an oil.</p>

<p>3. Excess of oil in proportion to the number of yolks, the
assimilating power of an egg being limited to two and one-half oz. of oil (if the sauce be made some time in advance), and three oz. if it is to be used immediately.</p>

<p><i>Means of Bringing Turned Mayonnaise Back to its Normal
State.</i>—Put the yolk of an egg into a basin with a few drops
of vinegar, and mix the turned Mayonnaise in it, little by
little. If it be a matter of only a small quantity of Mayonnaise,
one-half a coffeespoonful of mustard can take the place of the
egg-yolk. Finally, with regard to acid seasoning, a whiter
sauce is obtained by the use of lemon juice instead of vinegar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="127—Cleared Mayonnaise Sauce"><a id="rcp.127"

intended.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—It is this very Mayonnaise, formerly used almost
exclusively for coating entrées and cold relevées of fish, filleted
fish, escalopes of common and spiny-lobster, &amp;c., which I
have allowed the Lenten Chaud-froid (see remarks No. <a href="#rcp.76">76</a>) to

<h3 class="subhead" title="Compound Butters for Grills and for the Completion of
Sauces">Compound Butters for Grills and for the Completion of
Sauces</h3>

<p>With the exception of those of the shell-fish order, the butters,
whose formulæ I am about to give, are not greatly used in
kitchens. Nevertheless, in some cases, as, for instance, in accentuating
the savour of sauces, they answer a real and useful purpose,
and I therefore recommend them, since they enable one to
give a flavour to the derivatives of the Velouté and Béchamel
sauces which these could not acquire by any other means.</p>

<p>With regard to shell-fish butters, and particularly those of the
common and spiny lobster and the crayfish, experience has
shown that when they are prepared with heat (that is to say, by
melting in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> a quantity of butter which has been
previously pounded with shell-fish remains and afterwards
strained through muslin into a basin of iced-water where it has
solidified) they are of a finer colour than the other kind and
quite free from shell particles. But the heat, besides dissipating
a large proportion of their delicacy, involves considerable
risk, for the slightest neglect gives the above preparation
quite a disagreeable taste. To obviate these difficulties I have
adopted a system of two distinct butters, one which is exclusively
calorific<!-- TN: original reads "colorific" --> and prepared with heat, and the other which is prepared
with all the creamy parts, the trimmings and the remains of common
and spiny lobsters, without the shells, pounded with the required
quantity of fresh butter and passed through a sieve. The
latter is used to complete sauces, particularly those with a
Béchamel base to which it lends a perfect savour.</p>

<p>I follow the same procedure with shrimp and crayfish butters,
<a id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sometimes substituting for the butter good cream, which, I find,
absorbs the aromatic principles perhaps better than the former.
With the above method it is advisable to pass the butter or the
cream through a very fine sieve first and afterwards through
tammy, so as to avoid small particles of the pounded shell being
present in the sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="139—Bercy Butter"><a id="rcp.139"

<p>Put into a small stewpan one-quarter pint of white wine and

marrow cut into cubes, poached in slightly salted water and well
drained, the necessary table-salt, and, when dishing up, a little
ground pepper and a few drops of lemon-juice.</p>

remove the water, and pound in a mortar. Now add
one-half lb. of half-melted butter, mix well with the purée of

<p>Put on to a dish any available remains of shell-fish after
having thoroughly emptied and well dried them in the oven.
Pound them until they form a fine powder, and add their weight
of butter.</p>

<p>Put the whole into a saucepan and melt in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, stirring
frequently the while. When the butter is quite clarified
strain it through muslin, twisting the latter over a tureen of iced-water
in which the strained butter solidifies. Put the congealed
butter in a towel, press it heavily so as to expel the water, and
keep cool in a small bowl.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—A very fine and decided red colour is obtained by
using paprika as a condiment for sauces intended for poultry and
certain butcher’s meats, in accordance with the procedure I recommend
for the Hongroise. But only the very best quality
should be used—that which is mild and at the same time produces
a nice pink colour without entailing any excess of the
condiment. Among the various kinds of paprika on the market
I can highly recommend that of Messrs. Kotangi, which I have
invariably found satisfactory.</p>

in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, and pour it on to a serviette stretched over
a bowl in order to drain away the water. Collect the remains
of the colouring substance on the serviette, making use of a
palette-knife for the purpose, and put these into a mortar; mix
with half their weight of butter, strain through a sieve or tammy,

 ><small class="smc">Savoury Jellies or Aspics</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">Jellies</span> are to cold cookery what consommés and stock are to
hot. If anything, the former are perhaps more important, for
a cold entrée—however perfect it may be in itself—is nothing
without its accompanying jelly.</p>

<p>In the recipes which I give hereafter I have made a point of
showing how melting jellies may be obtained, <i>i.e.</i>, served in a
sauce-boat simultaneously with the cold comestible, or actually
poured over it when the latter lies in a deep dish—a common
custom nowadays.</p>

<p>This method of serving cold entrées, which I inaugurated at
the Savoy Hotel with the “Suprême de Volaille Jeannette,” is
the only one which allows of serving a jelly in a state of absolute
perfection.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a more solid jelly were required, either for the
decking of cold dishes or for a moulded entrée, there need only
be added to the following formulæ a few gelatine leaves—more
or less—according to the required firmness of the jelly.</p>

<p>But it should not be forgotten that the greater the viscosity
of the jelly the less value will the same possess.</p>

<p>The various uses of jellies are dealt with in Part II. of this
work, where the formulæ of their divers accompanying dishes
will also appear.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="158—Ordinary Aspics"><a id="rcp.158"
 >158—ORDINARY ASPICS</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Stock for Ordinary Aspic.—Quantities for making Four Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>4 lbs. of strung knuckle of veal.</p>
<p>3 lbs. of strung knuckle of beef.</p>
<p>3 lbs. of veal bones, well broken up.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>3 calf’s feet, boned and <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a>.</p>
<p>½ lb. of fresh pork rind, well <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> and with fat removed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Put the meats in a very clean and well-tinned
stockpot or stewpan. Add eight quarts of cold water,
boil, and skim after the manner indicated under <a href="#rcp.1">No. 1</a>. Having
well skimmed the stock add one oz. of salt, put it on the side of
<a id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the fire, and let it boil gently for four hours. Then remove the
meat, taking care not to disturb the stock. Carefully remove
the fat, and garnish with one-half lb. of carrots, six oz. of
onions, two oz. of leeks, a stick of celery, and a large faggot.
Put the whole back on to the fire and cook gently for a further
two hours. Strain through a sieve into a very clean basin and
leave to cool.</p>

<p><i>Clarification of Aspic.</i>—When the stock, prepared according
to the above directions, has cooled, the grease that has formed on
its surface should be removed. Then pour off gently into a stewpan
of convenient size in such a way as to prevent the deposit at
the bottom of the basin from mixing with the clear liquor. Test
the consistence of the aspic, when it should be found that the
quantities given above have proved sufficient to form a fairly
firm jelly. If, however, this be not the case, a few leaves of
gelatine steeped in cold water should be added, being careful not
to overdo the quantity. Now add to the stock two lbs. of lean
beef (first minced and then pounded together with the white of
an egg), a little chervil and tarragon, and a few drops of lemon-juice.
Place the saucepan on an open fire, stir its contents with a
spatula until the liquid begins to boil, remove it from the fire,
and place it on the side of the stove, where it may boil gently for
half an hour.</p>

<p>At the end of this time take the saucepan off the fire and
remove what little grease has formed on the aspic while cooking.
Strain through a serviette stretched and fastened across the legs
of an overturned stool, and let the aspic fall into a basin placed
between the legs. Ascertain whether the liquid is quite
clear, and if, as frequently happens, this be not the case, what
has already been strained should once more be passed through
the serviette, renewing the operation until the aspic becomes
quite transparent.</p>

<p><i>Flavouring the Aspic.</i>—The aspic obtained as above is limpid,
has an agreeable savour, and is the colour of fine amber. It now
only requires flavouring according to the tastes of the consumer
and the purpose for which it is intended. For this operation it
should be allowed to become quite tepid, and the following quantities
of choice wine are added to it, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span></p>

<p>If the wine is of a liqueur kind, such as Sherry, Marsala,
Madeira, &amp;c., one-fifth pint per quart.</p>

<p>If it is another kind of wine, for example, champagne, hock, &amp;c., one-fourth pint per quart.</p>

<p>The wine used should be very clear, free from any deposit,
and as perfect as possible in taste.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="159—Chicken Aspic"><a id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.159"
 >159—CHICKEN ASPIC</a></h3>

<p>The quantities of meat are the same as for ordinary aspic;
there need only be added to it either two oven-browned hens, or
their equivalent in weight of roasted fowl carcases, and poultry
giblets if these are handy. It is always better, however, to prepare
the stock with the hens and giblets and to keep the carcases
for the clarification. This clarification follows the same rules
as that of the ordinary aspic, except that a few roasted-fowl carcases,
previously well freed from fat, are added to it.</p>

<p>In the case of this particularly delicate aspic, it is more than
ever necessary not to overdo the amount of gelatine. It should
be easily soluble to the palate in order to be perfect.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="160—Game Aspic"><a id="rcp.160"
 >160—GAME ASPIC</a></h3>

<p>Prepare this aspic stock in exactly the same way as that of
ordinary aspic, only substitute game, such as deer, roebuck, doe,
or hare, or wild rabbit (previously browned in the oven), for the
beef. When possible also add to this stock a few old specimens
of feathered game, such as partridges or pheasants that are too
tough for other purposes and which suit admirably here.</p>

<p>The clarification changes according to the different flavours
which are to be given to the aspic. If it is not necessary to give
it a special characteristic, it should be prepared with the meat of
that ground game which happens to be most available at the
time, adding to the quantity used roast carcases of feathered
game, the respective amounts of both ingredients being the same
as for ordinary aspic. If, on the other hand, the aspic is to have
a well-defined flavour, the meat used for the clarification should
naturally be that producing the flavour in question, <i>i.e.</i>, either
partridge or pheasant, or hazel-hen, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some aspics are greatly improved by being flavoured with a
small quantity of old brandy. Rather than use an inferior kind
of this ingredient, however, I should advise its total omission
from the aspic.</p>

<p>Without aromatisation the aspic, though imperfect, is passable;
but aromatised with bad brandy it is invariably spoilt.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="161—Fish Aspic with White Wine"><a id="rcp.161"
 >161—FISH ASPIC WITH WHITE WINE</a></h3>

<p>The stock for this aspic is prepared in precisely the same
manner as fish stock, <a href="#rcp.1">No. 1</a>. The stewpan need not, however, be
buttered previous to the insertion of the onions, parsley-stalks,
<a id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and fish-bones. If the aspic is not required to be quite white, a
little saffron may be added to it, as the aroma of this condiment
blends so perfectly with that of fish.</p>

<p>When the stock is prepared its consistence should be tested,
and rectified, if necessary, by means of gelatine. The quantity
of this substance should on no account exceed eight leaves per
quart of aspic, and, at the risk of repeating myself, I remind the
reader that the less gelatine is used the better the aspic will be.</p>

<p>The clarification should be made with fresh caviare if possible,
but pressed caviare is also admirably suited to this purpose.
The quantities are the same as for the clarification of fish consommé,
<a href="#rcp.4">No. 4</a>.</p>

<p>In flavouring white fish aspics either dry champagne or a
good Bordeaux or Burgundy may be used. Take care, however—</p>

<p>1. That the wine used be of an unquestionably good quality.</p>

<p>2. That it be only added to the aspic when the latter is
already cold and on the point of coagulating, as this is the
only means of preserving all the aroma of the wine.</p>

<p>Finally, in certain cases, a special flavour may be obtained
by the use of crayfish, which are cooked, as for bisque, then
pounded, and added to the fish stock No. <a href="#rcp.11">11</a> ten minutes before
straining it. A proportion of four little crayfish à bisque per
quart of aspic is sufficient to secure an excellent aroma.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="162—Fish Aspic with Red Wine"><a id="rcp.162"
 >162—FISH ASPIC WITH RED WINE</a></h3>

<p>This aspic stock is the <i>Court-bouillon</i> with red wine No. <a href="#rcp.165">165</a>, which has served in cooking the fish for which the aspic
is intended; this fish is generally either trout or salmon; sometimes
also, but less commonly, a carp or a pike.</p>

<p>This stock must first of all have its grease thoroughly removed;
it should then be poured carefully away, reduced if
necessary, and the required quantity of gelatine added. This
cannot be easily determined, as all gelatines are not alike, and
the stock may have contracted a certain consistence from its
contact with the fish. One can, therefore, only be guided by
testing small quantities cooled in ice, but care should be taken
that the aspic be not too firm.</p>

<p>The clarification of this aspic is generally made with white
of egg in the proportion of one white per quart. The white,
half-whisked, is added to the cold stock, and the latter is
put over an open fire and stirred with a spatula. As soon
as it boils, the aspic is poured through a serviette fixed on to
<a id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the legs of an overturned stool. The first drippings of the fluid
are put back on to the serviette if they do not seem clear, and
this operation is repeated until the required clearness is obtained.</p>

<p>It almost invariably happens that, either during the cooking
of the fish or during the clarification, the wine loses its
colour through the precipitation of the colouring elements derived
from the tannin.</p>

<p>The only way of overcoming this difficulty is to add a few
drops of liquid carmine or vegetable red; but, in any case, it is
well to remember that the colour of red-wine aspic must never
be deeper than a sombre pink.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="163—Court-bouillon with Vinegar"><a id="rcp.163"
 >163—COURT-BOUILLON WITH VINEGAR</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Five Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>5 quarts of water.</p>
<p>½ pint of vinegar.</p>
<p>2 oz. of gray salt.</p>
<p>½ oz. of peppercorns.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>¾ lb. of carrots.</p>
<p>1 lb. of onions.</p>
<p>A little thyme and bay.</p>
<p>2 oz. of parsley stalks.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Put into a saucepan the water, salt, and
vinegar, the minced carrots and onions, and the parsley, thyme,
and bay, gathered into a bunch. Boil, allow to simmer for
one hour, rub through tammy, and put aside until wanted.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Put the peppercorns into the <i>court-bouillon</i>
only twelve minutes before straining the latter. If the pepper
were in for too long a time it would give a bitterness to the
preparation. This rule also applies to the formulæ that follow,
in which the use of peppercorns is also required.</p>

<p>This <i>court-bouillon</i> is principally used for cooking trout
and salmon, as well as for various shell-fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="164—Court-bouillon with White Wine"><a id="rcp.164"
 >164—COURT-BOUILLON WITH WHITE WINE</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Two Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>1 quart of white wine.</p>
<p>1 quart of water.</p>
<p>3 oz. of minced onions.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>1 large faggot.</p>
<p>½ oz. of gray salt.</p>
<p>A few peppercorns.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—This is the same as for the <i>court-bouillon</i> with
vinegar, except that it is boiled for half an hour and is strained
through tammy.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—If the <i>court-bouillon</i> has to be reduced the
quantity of salt should be proportionately less. This preparation
is principally used for poaching fresh-water fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="165—Court-bouillon with Red Wine"><a id="rcp.165"
 >165—COURT-BOUILLON WITH RED WINE</a></h3>

<p>Use the same quantities as for <i>court-bouillon</i> with white
wine, taking care—</p>

<p>1. To replace white wine by excellent red wine.</p>

<p><a id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>2. To add four oz. of minced carrots.</p>

<p>3. To apportion the wine and water in the ratio of two-thirds
to one-third.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—The same as that of the former, with the same
time for boiling.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—If the <i>court-bouillon</i> is to be reduced, the salt
should be less accordingly. When the <i>court-bouillon</i> with red
wine is to constitute an aspic stock, fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> with enough
gelatine takes the place of the water.</p>

<p>The uses of <i>court-bouillon</i> with red wine are similar to
those of the white-wine kind.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="166—Plain Court-bouillon"><a id="rcp.166"
 >166—PLAIN COURT-BOUILLON</a></h3>

<p>The quantity of <i>court-bouillon</i> is determined by the size of
the piece which it is to cover. It is composed of cold, salt
water (the salt amounting to a little less than one-half oz. per
quart of water), one-quarter pint of milk per quart of water,
and one thin slice of peeled lemon in the same proportion.
The fish is immersed while the liquor is cold; the latter is very
slowly brought to the boil, and as soon as this is reached, the
receptacle is moved to the side of the fire, where the cooking
of the fish is completed.</p>

<p>This <i>court-bouillon</i>, which is used with large pieces of turbot
and brill, is never prepared beforehand.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="167—Special Court-bouillon, or Blanc"><a id="rcp.167"
 >167—SPECIAL COURT-BOUILLON, OR BLANC</a></h3>

<p>This preparation is a genuine <i>court-bouillon</i>, though it is
not used in cooking fish.</p>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>The Quantities Required for Five Quarts of this
Court-bouillon</i> <span class="nw"><i>are</i>:—</span></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>A little less than 2 oz. of flour.</p>
<p>1½ oz. of grey salt.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>The juice of 3 lemons or ⅛ pint of good vinegar.</p>
<p>5 quarts of cold water.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gradually mix the flour and the water; add the salt and
the lemon juice, and pass through a strainer. Set to boil, and
stir the mixture the while, in order to prevent the flour from
precipitating; as soon as the boil is reached, immerse the objects
to be treated. These are usually calf’s head or foot, previously
<a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a>; sheep’s trotters, cocks’ kidneys or combs, or such
vegetables as salsify, cardoon, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="subhead">Remarks upon the Use of Court-bouillon.</h3>

<p>1. <i>Court-bouillon</i> must always be prepared in advance for
all fish, the time for poaching which is less than half an hour,
except turbots and brills.</p>

<p><a id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>2. When a fish is of such a size as to need more than half
an hour’s poaching, proceed as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Place under the
drainer of the fish-kettle the minced carrots and onions and
the faggot; put the fish on the drainer, and cover it with
water and vinegar, or white wine, in accordance with the
kind of <i>court-bouillon</i> wanted and the quantity required. Add
the salt, boil, and keep the <i>court-bouillon</i> gently simmering for
a period of time fixed by the weight of the fish. The time
allowed for poaching the latter will be given in their respective
formulæ.</p>

<p>3. Fish, when whole, should be immersed in cold <i>court-bouillon</i>;
when sliced, in the same liquor, boiling. The exceptions
to this rule are small trout “au bleu” and shell-fish.</p>

<p>4. If fish be cooked in short liquor the aromatics are put
under the drainer and the liquid elements of the selected <i>court-bouillon</i>
(as, for example, that with red or white wine) are so
calculated as to cover only one-third of the solid body. Fish
cooked in this way should be frequently basted.</p>

<p>5. <i>Court-bouillon</i> for ordinary and spiny lobsters should
always be at full boiling pitch when these are immersed. The
case is the same for small or medium fish “au bleu.”</p>

<p>6. Fish which is to be served cold, also shell-fish, should
cool in the <i>court-bouillon</i> itself; the cooking period is consequently
curtailed.</p>


<h3 class="subhead">Marinades and Brines.</h3>

<p><i>Marinades</i> play but a small part in English cookery, venison
or other ground-game being generally preferred fresh. However,
in the event of its being necessary to resort to these
methods of preparation, I shall give two formulæ for venison
and two for mutton.</p>

<p>The use of the <i>marinade</i> for venison is very much debated.
Certainly it is often desirable that the fibre of those meats that
come from old specimens of the deer and boar species be
softened, but there is no doubt that what the meat gains in
tenderness it loses in flavour. On the whole, therefore, it would
be best to use only those joints which come from young beasts.</p>

<p>In the case of the latter, the <i>marinade</i> may well be dispensed
with. It would add nothing to the savour of a haunch of
venison, such as may be got in England, while it would be
equally ineffectual in the case of the roebuck or hare. A summary
treatment of these two, with raw <i>marinade</i>, may well
be adopted, as also for deer.</p>

<p><a id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>As for cooked <i>marinade</i>, its real and only use lies in the
fact that during stormy summer weather it enables one to preserve
meat which would otherwise have to be wasted. It may,
moreover, be used for braised venison, but this treatment of
game is very uncommon nowadays.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="168—Cooked Marinade for Venison" id="g_marinade"><a id="rcp.168"
 >168—COOKED MARINADE FOR VENISON</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Five Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>½ lb. of minced carrots.</p>
<p>½ lb. of minced onions.</p>
<p>2 oz. of minced shallots.</p>
<p>1 crushed garlic clove.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>1 faggot, including 1 oz. of pars­ley stalks, 2 sprigs of rose­mary, as much thyme, and 2 bay leaves.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Heat one-half pint of oil in a stewpan, add
the carrots and onions, and fry them while stirring frequently.
When they begin to brown add the shallots, the garlic, and
the faggot, then one pint of vinegar, two bottles of white
wine, and three quarts of water. Cook this <i>marinade</i> for
twenty minutes, and add a further two oz. of salt, one-half oz.
of peppercorns, and four oz. of brown sugar. Ten minutes
afterwards pass it through a strainer and let it cool before inserting
the meats.</p>

<p>N.B.—In summer the <i>marinade</i> very often decomposes,
because of the blood contained by the meat under treatment in
it. The only means of averting this is to boil the <i>marinade</i>
every two or three days at least.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="169—Raw Marinade for Butcher’s Meat or Venison"><a id="rcp.169"
 >169—RAW MARINADE FOR BUTCHER’S MEAT <span class="nw">OR VENISON</span></a></h3>

<p>This <i>marinade</i> is prepared immediately before using. The
meat to be treated is first salted and peppered on all sides,
then it is put in a receptacle just large enough to hold
it, and laid therein on a litter of aromatics, including minced
carrots and onions, a few chopped shallots, parsley stalks,
thyme, and bay in proportion to the rest. Now sprinkle the
meat copiously with oil and half as much vinegar; cover the
dish with oil-paper, and put it somewhere in the cool.
Remember to turn the meat over three or four times a day,
covering it each time with a layer of vegetables.</p>

<p>This <i>marinade</i> is very active, and is admirably suited to
all butcher’s meat and venison, provided these be not allowed
to remain in it for too long a time. It is very difficult to say
how long the meat must stay in these <i>marinades</i>; the time varies
according to the size and quality of the joints, and the taste
of the consumer, &amp;c. All that can be said is that three hours
should be sufficient to <i>marinade</i> a cutlet or escalope of roebuck,
<a id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and that for big joints such as saddle or leg the time should
not exceed four days.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="170—Marinade for Mutton, Roebuck-style"><a id="rcp.170"
 >170—MARINADE FOR MUTTON, ROEBUCK-STYLE</a></h3>

<p>This is exactly the same as cooked <i>marinade</i>, No. <a href="#rcp.168">168</a>.
There need only be added one oz. of juniper berries, a few
sprigs of rosemary, wild thyme, and basil, two extra garlic
cloves, and one quart less of water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="171—Marinade with Red Wine for Mutton"><a id="rcp.171"
 >171—MARINADE WITH RED WINE FOR MUTTON</a></h3>

<p>By substituting red wine for white in the preceding formula—the
quantity of the liquid equalling that of the water—and by
slightly increasing the quantity of aromatics, an excellent
<i>marinade</i> for mutton is obtained, which in summer enables one
to preserve meat, otherwise perishable, for some days.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="172—Brine"><a id="rcp.172"
 >172—BRINE</a></h3>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Quantities Required for Fifty Quarts.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>56 lbs. of gray salt.</p>
<p>50 quarts of water.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>6 lbs. of saltpetre.</p>
<p>3½ lbs. of brown sugar.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Put the salt and the water in a tinned
copper pan, and put it on an open fire. When the water boils,
throw in a peeled potato, and, if the latter float, add water until
it begins to sink. If, on the contrary, the potato should sink
immediately, reduce the liquid until it is able to buoy the
tuber up. At this stage the sugar and saltpetre are added;
let them dissolve, and the brine is then removed from the
fire and is allowed to cool. It is then poured into the receptacle
intended for it, which must be either of slate, stone,
cement, or well-jointed tiles. It is well to place in the bottom
of this reservoir a wooden lattice, whereon the meats to be
salted may be laid, for, were the immersed objects to lie directly
on the bottom of the receptacle, the under parts would be
entirely shielded from the brine.</p>

<p>If the meats to be salted are of an appreciable size, they should
be inoculated with brine by means of a special syringe. Without
this measure it would be impossible to salt regularly, as
the sides would already be over-saturated before the centre had
even been properly reached.</p>

<p>Eight days should be allowed for salting a piece of beef
of what size soever, above eight or ten lb., since the process
of inoculation equalises the salting.</p>

<p>Ox-tongue intended for salting, besides having to be as
<a id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fresh as possible, must be trimmed of almost all the cartilage
of the throat, and carefully beaten either with a beater or
roller. Then it must be pricked on all sides with a string-needle,
and immersed in the liquid, where it should be slightly
weighted by some means or other in order to prevent its rising
to the surface. A medium-sized tongue would need about seven
days’ immersion in the brine.</p>

<p>Though brine does not turn as easily as the cooked
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinades</a></i>, it would be well, especially in stormy weather, to
watch it and occasionally to boil it. But, as the process of
boiling invariably concentrates the brine, a little water
should be added to it every time it is so treated, and the test
of the potato, described above, should always be resorted to.</p>

en place</a></i> were not, at least summarily, discussed here, I should
be compelled to repeat them in each formula for which they
are required—that is to say, in almost every formula. I should
thus resemble those bad operators who, having neglected their
<i><a href="#g_mise-en-place">mise en place</a></i>, are obliged to make it in the course of other
work, and thereby not only run the risk of making it badly,
but also of losing valuable time which might be used to better
advantage.</p>

<p>Elementary preparations consist of those things whereof
one is constantly in need, which may be prepared in advance,
and which are kept available for use at a moment’s notice.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="173—Anchovies (Fillets of)"><a id="rcp.173"
 >173—ANCHOVIES (FILLETS OF)</a></h3>

<p>Whether they be for hors d’œuvres or for culinary use, it
is always best to have these handy.</p>

<p>After having washed and well wiped them, in order to remove
the white powder resulting from the little scales with
which they are covered, they should be neatly trimmed to the
shape of extended oblongs. Then detach the fillets from the
bones by gentle pulling, divide each fillet lengthwise into three
or four smaller fillets, put the latter into a small narrow dish
or a little bowl, and cover them with oil. The fillets may
also be kept whole with a view to rolling them into rings.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="174—Anglaise (for Egg-and-bread-crumbing)" id="g_anglaise_1"><a id="rcp.174"
 >174—ANGLAISE (FOR EGG-AND-BREAD-CRUMBING)</a></h3>

<p>It is well to have this always ready for those dishes which
are to be <i>panés à l’anglaise</i>, or as many of the recipes direct:
<i>treated à l’anglaise</i>.</p>

<p><a id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It is made of well-whisked eggs, salt, pepper, and one
dessertspoonful of oil per couple of eggs.</p>

<p><i>Its Uses.</i>—The solids to be <i>panés à l’anglaise</i> are dipped
into the preparation described above, taking care that the latter
coats them thoroughly; whereupon, according to the requirements,
they are rolled either in bread-crumbs or in fine raspings.
From this combination of egg with bread-crumbs or raspings
there results a kind of coat which, at the moment of contact with
the hot fat, is immediately converted into a resisting crust. In
<i>croquettes</i> this crust checks the escape, into the fat, of the substances
it encloses, and this is more especially the case when
the <i>croquettes</i> contain some reduced sauce, or are composed
of raw meats or fish whose juices are thereby entirely retained.
A solid prepared <i>à l’anglaise</i> and cooked in fat should
always be put into the latter when this is very hot, so as to
ensure the instantaneous solidification of the egg and bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>N.B.—Objects to be treated <i>à l’anglaise</i> are generally
rolled in flour before being immersed in the <a href="#g_anglaise_3"><i>anglaise</i></a>, for the
flour helps the foregoing to adhere to the object.</p>

<p>The crust formed over the solid thus acquires a density which
is indispensable.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="174a—Aromatics"><a id="rcp.174a"
 >174a—AROMATICS</a></h3>

<p>Aromatics play a very prominent part in cookery, and their
combination with the condiments constitutes, as Grimod<!-- TN: original reads "Grinod" --> de la
Reynière said, “the hidden soul of cooking.” Their real
object, in fact, is to throw the savour of dishes into relief, to
intensify that savour, and to give each culinary preparation its
particular stamp.</p>

<p>They are all derived from the vegetable kingdom; but, while
some are used dry, others are used fresh.</p>

<p>The first-named should belong to the permanent kitchen
stock; they are: <i>sage</i>, <i>basil</i>, <i>rosemary</i>, <i>sweet marjoram</i>, <i>thyme</i>,
and <i>bay</i>.</p>

<p>Also to be included in the permanent stock are: <i>cinnamon</i>,
<i>ginger</i>, <i>juniper-berries</i>, <i>nutmeg</i>, <i>cloves</i>, <i>mace</i>, and <i>vanilla</i>.</p>

<p>The last-named comprise those aromatic herbs used fresh,
such as: <i>parsley</i>, <i>chervil</i>, <i>tarragon</i>, <i>pimpernel</i>, and <i>common
savory</i>; while, under this head, there may also be included:
bits of common- and Seville-orange rind and <i><a href="#g_zest">zests</a></i> of lemon
rind.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="174b—Seasoning and Condiments"><a id="rcp.174b"
 >174b—SEASONING AND CONDIMENTS</a></h3>

<p>Seasonings are divided into several classes, which <span class="nw">comprise:—</span></p>

<p><a id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>1. <i>Saline seasonings.</i>—Salt, spiced salt, saltpetre.</p>

<p>2. <i>Acid seasonings.</i>—Plain vinegar, or the same aromatised
with tarragon; verjuice, lemon juice, and common- or Seville-orange
juices.</p>

<p>3. <i>Hot seasonings.</i>—Peppercorns, ground or <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i>
pepper, or mignonette; paprika, curry, cayenne, and compound
spices.</p>

<p>4. <i>Saccharine seasonings.</i>—Sugar and honey.</p>

<p>Condiments are likewise subdivided, the three classes
<span class="nw">being:—</span></p>

<p>1.<!-- TN: original reads "(1)" --> <i>The pungents.</i>—Onions, shallots, garlic, chives, and
horseradish.</p>

<p>2. <i>Hot condiments.</i>—Mustard, gherkins, capers, English
sauces, such as Worcester, Harvey, Ketchup, Escoffier’s sauces, &amp;c.; the wines used in reductions and braisings; the finishing
elements of sauces and soups.</p>

<p>3. <i>Fatty substances.</i>—Most animal fats, butter, vegetable
greases (edible oils and cocoanut butter).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—In cookery it should be borne in mind that both
excellence and eatableness depend entirely upon a judicious use
and a rational blending of the aromatics, seasonings, and condiments.
And, according as the latter have been used and
apportioned, their action will be either beneficial or injurious
to the health of the consumer.</p>

<p>In the matter of seasoning there can be no question of
approximation or half measures; the quantities must be exact,
allowing only of slight elasticity in respect of the various tastes
to be satisfied.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="175—Clarified Butter"><a id="rcp.175"
 >175—CLARIFIED BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>A certain quantity of clarified butter should always be kept
ready and handy.</p>

<p>To prepare this butter, put one lb. to melt in a saucepan
large enough to hold twice that amount. Place the saucepan
on the side of the fire, over moderate heat; remove all the scum
which rises to the surface, and, when the butter looks quite
clear and all foreign substances have dropped to the bottom,
put the liquid carefully away and strain it through muslin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="176—Faggots (Bouquets Garnis)"><a id="rcp.176"
 >176—FAGGOTS (BOUQUETS GARNIS)</a></h3>

<p>The name “faggot” is given to those little bunches of
aromatics which, when the contrary is not stated, are generally
composed (in order to weigh one ounce) of eight-tenths oz. of
<a id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>parsley stalks and roots, one-tenth oz. of bay leaves, and one-tenth oz. of thyme. These various aromatics are put neatly
together so that no sprig of the one sticks out beyond the
others, and they are properly strung together.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="177—Chervil"><a id="rcp.177"
 >177—CHERVIL</a></h3>

<p><i>Chopped Chervil.</i>—Clean the chervil and remove the stalks;
wash, dry it well while tossing it, then chop it finely and put
it aside on a plate in the cool, if it is not for immediate use.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_concass">Concassed</a> Chervil.</i>—Proceed as above, except that, instead
of chopping it, compress it between the fingers and slice it after
the manner of a chaff-cutter. <i><a href="#g_concass">Concassed</a></i> and chopped chervil
are, if possible, only prepared at the last moment.</p>

<p><i>Chervil Pluches.</i>—The <a href="#g_pluches">pluches</a> are greatly used in the
finishing off of soups. They are, practically, the serrated portions
only of the leaves, which are torn away in such a manner
as to show no trace of the veinings. They are immersed in
water, and at the last moment withdrawn, so as to be added,
raw, to either soups or boiling consommés.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="178—Raspings"><a id="rcp.178"
 >178—RASPINGS</a></h3>

<p>Golden raspings are obtained by pounding and passing
through a fine sieve bread-crusts which have been previously
well dried in the oven.</p>

<p><i>White raspings</i> are similarly prepared, except that very dry,
white crumb is used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="179—Peeled, Channelled, and Zested Lemons"><a id="rcp.179"
 >179—PEELED, CHANNELLED, AND ZESTED LEMONS</a></h3>

<p>Lemons are greatly used in cookery, as dish and comestible
garnish. When a whole lemon is used for <a href="#g_marinade">marinades</a> of fish,
for the “<i>blancs</i>,” &amp;c., it is well to peel it to the pulp, <i>i.e.</i>, to
remove the peel and the whole of the underlying white. The
lemon is then cut into more or less large slices, according to
the use for which it is intended.</p>

<p>The rind of a lemon thus peeled may be cut into bits and
used in this form as the necessity arises. When cutting it up,
flatten the rind inside uppermost on the table, and, with a very
sharp and flexible knife, remove all the white; then slice the
remaining peel (which constitutes what is called <i><a href="#g_zest">zest</a></i>) into strips
about one inch wide, and cut these laterally in fine <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>.</p>

<p>Scald the resulting bits for five minutes, cool them, drain
them carefully, and put them aside until wanted. Sometimes,
instead of cutting <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>, the <i><a href="#g_zest">zest</a></i> may be finely
chopped, but the rest of the process remains the same.</p>

<p><a id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Lemons are channelled by means of a little knife, or a special
instrument for the purpose, which excises parallel ribbons from
the surface of the rind and lays the white bare. A lemon
channelled in this way is cut in two, lengthwise with the core;
its two extremities are removed, and the two halves are cut
laterally into thin, regular slices to look like serrated half-discs.</p>

<p>The lemon may also be cut at right angles to the core.</p>

<p>Fried fish, oysters, and certain game are generally garnished
with lemon slices fashioned according to the taste of the cook;
but the simplest, and perhaps the best, way is to cut the lemon
through the centre, after having trimmed the two ends quite
straight, and then to remove the rind roughly from the edge.</p>

<p>For whatever purpose the lemon be intended, it should be,
as far as possible, only prepared at the last moment. If it must
be prepared beforehand, it would be well to keep it in a bowl
of fresh water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="180—Shallots"><a id="rcp.180"
 >180—SHALLOTS</a></h3>

<p><i>Chopped Shallots.</i>—Clean the shallots, and, by means of a
very sharp knife, cut them lengthwise into thin slices; let these
cling together by not allowing the knife to cut quite through
them, and, this done, turn them half round and proceed in the
same way at right angles to the other cuts.</p>

<p>Finally, cut them laterally, and this will be found to produce
very fine and regular, small cubes.</p>

<p><i>Ciseled Shallots.</i>—The name “<i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i> shallots” is often
erroneously given to those shallots resulting from the above
process.</p>

<p>But <i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i> shallots are merely laterally sliced, the result of
which operation is a series of thin, regular discs. <i><a href="#g_cisel">Ciseled</a></i> or
chopped shallots should, when possible, only be prepared when
required; if, however, they must be treated in advance, they
should be kept somewhere in the cool until wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="181—Spices"><a id="rcp.181"
 >181—SPICES</a></h3>

<p>Strictly speaking, spices include cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger,
mace; and the many varieties of peppers and pimenta, cayenne,
paprika, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These various condiments are found ready-made on the
market, and they need only be kept dry in air-tight boxes in
order to prevent the escape of their aroma.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of preparation, in cookery, to
which the name of spice or all-spice is more especially given.
<a id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Nowadays several market varieties of this preparation exist, and
vie with each other for custom, though in most cases they
deserve it equally well.</p>

<p>Formerly this was not so, and every chef had his own
formula.</p>

<p>The following is a recipe for the spice in question, which
would be found useful if it had to be prepared at a moment’s
<span class="nw">notice:—</span></p>

<h4 class="ingred" title=""><i>Obtain the following, very dry.</i></h4>

<div class="ctr">
<div class="ingredients">
<p>5 oz. of bay leaves.</p>
<p>3 oz. of thyme (half of it wild, if possible).</p>
<p>3 oz. of coriander.</p>
<p>4 oz. of cinnamon.</p>
<p>6 oz. of nutmeg.</p>
</div><div class="ingredients">
<p>4 oz. of cloves.</p>
<p>3 oz. of ginger-root.</p>
<p>3 oz. of mace.</p>
<p>10 oz. of mixed pepper (half black and half white).</p>
<p>1 oz. of cayenne.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Put all these ingredients into a mortar and pound them until
they are all able to pass through a very fine sieve. Put the
resulting powder into an air-tight box, which must be kept dry.</p>

<p>Before being used, this spice is generally mixed with salt
(No. <a href="#rcp.188">188</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="182—Flour"><a id="rcp.182"
 >182—FLOUR</a></h3>

<p>For whatever use the flour is intended, it is always best to
sift it. This is more particularly necessary in the case of flour
used for coating objects to be fried; for the latter, being first
dipped into milk, must of necessity let a few drops of that
liquid fall into the flour they are rolled in. Lumps would
therefore form, which might adhere to the objects to be fried
if the flour were not sifted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="183—Herb Juice"><a id="rcp.183"
 >183—HERB JUICE</a></h3>

<p>This is to finish or intensify certain preparations.</p>

<p>To prepare it, throw into a small saucepan of boiling water
some parsley, chervil, and tarragon and chive leaves, in equal
quantities, according to the amount of juice required.</p>

<p>Set to boil for two minutes, drain, cool, press the herbs in
a towel, twisting the latter; pound very finely, and extract the
juice from the resulting paste by twisting a strong towel
round it.</p>

<p>Keep this juice in the cool.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="184—Bread-crumbs"><a id="rcp.184"
 >184<!-- TN: original reads "84" -->—BREAD-CRUMBS</a></h3>

<p>Thoroughly rub, in a closed towel, some stale bread-crumb
previously well broken up. Pass it through a fine sieve or
colander, according as to whether it is required very fine or not,
and put it aside in a convenient receptacle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="185—Chopped Onion"><a id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.185"
 >185—CHOPPED ONION</a></h3>

<p>Cut the onion finely, like the shallots, but if it is to be
minced with a view to making it even finer, it should be freed
of its pungent juice, which would cause it to blacken with
exposure to the air.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, put the onion in the corner of a towel,
pour plenty of cold water over it, and twist the towel in order
to express the water. By this means the onion remains quite
white.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="186—Turned or Stoned Olives"><a id="rcp.186"
 >186—TURNED OR STONED OLIVES</a></h3>

<p>There are special instruments for stoning olives, but, failing
these, cut the fruit spirally from the stone with the point of a
small knife.</p>

<p>Keep the olives in slightly salted water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="187—Parsley"><a id="rcp.187"
 >187—PARSLEY</a></h3>

<p><i>Chopped Parsley.</i>—If parsley be properly chopped, no juice
should be produced. If, on the contrary, the operation be performed
badly, it amounts to a process of pounding which, perforce,
expresses the juice.</p>

<p>In the latter case the particles cohere, and they are sprinkled
with difficulty over an object. To remedy this shortcoming,
wash the choppings in fresh water, as in the case of the onion,
pressing in a similar manner so as to expel the water.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_concass">Concassed</a> Parsley</i> is that kind which is roughly chopped.
When a culinary preparation is dressed with <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> parsley,
the latter should be added to it a few moments before serving,
in order to undergo a slight cooking process; whereas chopped
parsley may be strewn over a dish at the last moment.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that parsley, when quite fresh and
used in moderation, is an excellent thing; but, should it have
remained too long in the heat, it becomes quite insufferable.</p>

<p>I cannot, therefore, too strongly urge the advisability of
using it in the freshest possible state, and it would even be
wiser to discard it entirely than to be forced to ignore this
condition.</p>

<p><i>Parsley Sprays.</i>—These are chiefly used in garnishing
dishes, and it is well for the purpose to make as much use as
possible of the curled-leaf kind, after having removed the long
stalks. Keep the sprays in fresh water until required.</p>

<p><i>Fried Parsley.</i>—This consists of the sprays, well drained of
water after washing, and immersed for an instant in very hot
fat. The moment it is fried carefully drain it, salt it, and place
<a id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it in a clean towel, where it may get rid of any superfluous
grease. It is used to dress fried viands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="188—Salt"><a id="rcp.188"
 >188—SALT</a></h3>

<p>Two kinds of salt are used in cooking, viz., grey, or sea-salt,
and rock-salt. Grey-salt is used more especially for Brines
and in the preparation of ices, as its grey colour does not
allow of its being used indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, many prefer it to rock-salt for the salting
of stock-pots, roasts, and grills. For the last two purposes it
is crushed with a roller, without being pounded, and the result
should be such that every grain is distinctly perceptible to the
touch.</p>

<p>This salt, in melting over a roast or a grill, certainly imparts
a supplementary flavour to the latter which could not be got with
the use of rock-salt.</p>

<p><i>Rock-salt.</i>—This is found on the market in the forms of
cooking and table-salt. If the kitchen is only supplied with
cooking salt, the quantity required for several days should be
dried, pounded in the mortar, and passed through a fine sieve;
and then put aside in a dry place for use when wanted. Even
table-salt, as it reaches one from the purveyor, sometimes needs
drying and passing through a sieve before being used.</p>

<p><i>Spiced Salt.</i>—This condiment, which serves an important
purpose in the preparation of pies and galantines, is obtained
from a mixture of one lb. of table salt with three and one-half oz.
of spices (No. <a href="#rcp.181">181</a>).</p>

<p>This kind of salt should be carefully kept in a very dry place.</p>

<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="189—Various Panadas for Stuffings"><a id="rcp.189"
 >189—VARIOUS PANADAS FOR STUFFINGS</a></h3>

<p>Panadas are those preparations which go to make the leason
of forcemeats and which ensure their proper consistence when
they are cooked. They are not necessary to every forcemeat; for
the <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> kind, which are the finest and lightest, do not
require them. Nevertheless, they are useful for varying the taste
and the uses of forcemeats, and I thought it advisable to introduce
them here. The reader will thus be able to use either
forcemeats with a panada base or <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeats; in
accordance with the requirements and his resources.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="190—A. Bread Panada"><a id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.190"
 >190—A. BREAD PANADA</a></h3>

<p>Put one-half lb. of the crumb of bread and one-half oz. of
salt into one-half pint of boiling milk. When the crumb has
absorbed all the milk, place the saucepan over a brisk fire and
stir with a spatula until the paste has become so thick as not to
cling any longer to the end of the spatula. Turn the contents of
the saucepan into a buttered platter, and lightly butter the surface
of the panada in order to avoid its drying while it cools.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="191—B. Flour Panada"><a id="rcp.191"
 >191—B. FLOUR PANADA</a></h3>

<p>Put into a small saucepan one-half pint of water, a little salt,
and two oz. of butter. When the liquid boils add five oz. of sifted
flour thereto, stirring the while over a brisk fire until it reaches
the consistence described in the case of bread panada. Use the
same precautions with regard to cooling.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="192—C. Frangipan Panada"><a id="rcp.192"
 >192—C. FRANGIPAN PANADA</a></h3>

<p>Put into a stewpan four oz. of sifted flour, the yolks of four
eggs, a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Now add by degrees
three oz. of melted butter and dilute with one-half pint of boiled
milk. Pass through a strainer, stir over the fire until the boil is
reached; set to cook for five minutes while gently wielding the
whisk, and cool as in the preceding cases.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="193—Chicken Forcemeat with Panada and Butter"><a id="rcp.193"
 >193—CHICKEN FORCEMEAT WITH PANADA AND BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Remove the tendons from, and cut into cubes, one lb. of
chicken-meat. Pound, and add one-third oz. of salt, a little
pepper and nutmeg. When the meat is well pounded remove it
from the mortar, and place in its stead one-half lb. of very cold
panada (see No. <a href="#rcp.190">190</a>). Finely pound this panada, and then add
one-half lb. of butter thereto, taking care that the two ingredients
mix thoroughly. Now put in the chicken-meat, and wield the
pestle vigorously until the whole mass is completely mixed.
Finally, add consecutively two whole eggs and the yolks of four,
stirring incessantly the while and seeing that each egg is only
inserted when the one preceding it has become perfectly incorporated
with the mass. Rub through a sieve, put the forcemeat
into a basin, and smooth it with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Test the forcemeat by poaching a small portion of it in salted,
boiling water. This test, which is indispensable, allows of rectifying
the seasoning and the consistence if necessary. If it be
found that the forcemeat is too light, a little white of egg could
<a id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be mingled with it; if, on the other hand, it should be too stiff
add a little softened butter.</p>

<p>N.B.—By substituting for chicken veal, game, or fish, &amp;c.,
any kind of forcemeat may be made; for the quantities of the
other ingredients remain the same whatever the basic meat may
be.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="194—Chicken Forcemeat with Panada and Cream"><a id="rcp.194"
 >194—CHICKEN FORCEMEAT WITH PANADA AND CREAM</a></h3>

<h3 class="subhead" title="">(For Fine Quenelles.)</h3>

<p>Finely pound one lb. of chicken-meat after having removed
the tendons, and seasoned with one-quarter oz. of salt, a little
pepper and nutmeg.</p>

<p>When the meat has been reduced to a fine paste, add, very
gradually, two oz. of white of egg. Finish with seven oz. of
Frangipan panada (No. <a href="#rcp.192">192</a>), and work vigorously with the pestle
until the whole is amalgamated. Strain through a fine sieve,
put the forcemeat into a vegetable-pan sufficiently large to allow
of ultimately working it with ease, and place it on ice for a good
hour.</p>

<p>This done, stir the forcemeat (still on the ice) for a few
seconds with a wooden spoon, then add, in small quantities at a
time, one pint of raw cream. At this stage complete the preparation
by adding thereto one-half pint of whipped cream. It
should then be found to be very white, smooth, and mellow.
Test as directed in the preceding recipe, and add a little white
of egg if it be too light, and a little cream if it be too stiff.</p>

<p>N.B.—This forcemeat may be prepared from all butcher’s
meats, game, or fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="195—Fine Chicken Forcemeat or “Mousseline”"><a id="rcp.195"
 >195—FINE CHICKEN FORCEMEAT OR “MOUSSELINE”</a></h3>

<p>Remove the tendons from, trim, and cut into cubes, one lb.
of chicken-meat. Season with one oz. of salt, a little pepper and
nutmeg.</p>

<p>Finely pound, and, when it is reduced to a paste, gradually
add the whites of two eggs, vigorously working with the pestle
meanwhile.</p>

<p>Strain through a fine sieve, put the forcemeat into a vegetable-pan,
stir it once more with the wooden spoon for a moment
or two, and combine with it, gradually, one pint of thick, fresh
cream, working with great caution and keeping the receptacle

<p><i>Remarks Relative to <a href="#g_mousseline">Mousseline</a> Forcemeat.</i>—This, like the
preceding forcemeats, may be prepared from any kind of meat.
<a id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The addition of the white of egg is not essential if the meats
used already possess a certain quantity of albumen; but without
the white of egg the forcemeat absorbs much less cream.</p>

<p>This forcemeat is particularly suited to preparations with a
shell-fish base. Incomparably delicate results are obtained by
the process, while it also furnishes ideal quenelles for the purpose
of garnishing soup. In a word, it may be said of <a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a>
forcemeat that, whereas it can replace all other kinds, none
of these can replace it.</p>

<p>N.B.—<i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousseline</a> forcemeats</i> of all kinds, with meat,
poultry, game, fish, or shell-fish, may be made according to the
principles and quantities given above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="196—Pork Forcemeat for Divers Uses"><a id="rcp.196"
 >196—PORK FORCEMEAT FOR DIVERS USES</a></h3>

<p>Remove the tendons of, and cut into large cubes, two lbs. of
fillet of pork, and the same weight of fresh, fat bacon. Season
with one and three-quarter oz. of spiced salt (No. <a href="#rcp.188">188</a>), chop the
fillet and bacon up, together or separately, pound them finely in
the mortar, and finish with two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of
brandy.</p>

<p>This forcemeat is used for ordinary pies and <i><a href="#g_terrine_1">terrines</a></i>. Strictly
speaking, it is “sausage-meat.” The inclusion of eggs in this
forcemeat really only obtains when it is used to stuff joints that
are to be braised, such as stuffed breast of veal; or in the case of
pies and <a href="#g_terrine_1">terrines</a>. The addition of the egg in these cases prevents
the grease from melting too quickly, and thus averts the
drying of the forcemeat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="197—Forcemeat for Galantines, Pies and Terrines"><a id="rcp.197"
 >197—FORCEMEAT FOR GALANTINES, PIES <span class="nw">AND TERRINES</span></a></h3>

<p>Remove the tendons from, and cut into cubes, one lb. of fillet
of veal and as much fillet of pork; add to these two lbs. of fresh,
fat bacon, also cut into cubes. Season with three oz. of spiced
salt, chop the three ingredients together or apart, and then finely
pound them. Finish with three eggs and three tablespoonfuls
of burnt brandy, strain through a sieve, and place in a basin.</p>

<p>When about to serve this stuffing, add to it a little <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>
corresponding with the meat that is to constitute the dish. For
<i><a href="#g_terrine_1">terrines</a></i>, pies, and galantines of game, one-quarter or one-fifth of
the forcemeat’s weight of <a href="#rcp.202">gratin stuffing</a> (proper to the game
under treatment) is added.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="198—Veal Forcemeat with Fat or Godiveau"><a id="rcp.198"
 >198—VEAL FORCEMEAT WITH FAT OR GODIVEAU</a></h3>

<p>Remove the tendons from, and cut into cubes, one lb. of fillet
of veal; also pare, <i>i.e.</i>, detach skin and filaments from, two lbs.
<a id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the very dry fat of kidneys of beef. First, chop these up
separately, then combine and pound them in the mortar. Season
with one-half oz. of salt, a little pepper, some nutmeg, and pound
afresh until the veal and fat become a homogeneous mass. Now
add four eggs, consecutively, and at intervals of a few minutes,
without ceasing to pound, and taking care only to insert each egg
after the preceding one has been properly mixed with the mass.
Spread the forcemeat thus prepared on a dish, and put the latter
on ice until the next day.</p>

<p>The next day pound once more, and add little by little fourteen oz. of very clean ice (in small pieces); or, instead, an equal
weight of iced water, adding this also very gradually.</p>

<p>When the godiveau is properly moistened, poach a small portion
of it in boiling water in order to test its consistence. If it
be too firm, add some more ice to it; if, on the other hand, it
seem too flimsy, add a little of the white of an egg. For the
uses of godiveau and quenelles see No. <a href="#rcp.205">205</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="199—Veal Forcemeat with Fat and Cream"><a id="rcp.199"
 >199—VEAL FORCEMEAT WITH FAT AND CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Chop finely and apart one lb. of very white fillet of veal, with
tendons removed, cut into cubes, and one lb. of the fat of pared
kidney of beef.</p>

<p>Combine the veal and the fat in the mortar, and pound until
the two ingredients form a fine and even paste. Season with one-half oz. of salt, a little pepper, and some nutmeg, and add consecutively
two eggs and two yolks, after the manner of the preceding
recipe and without ceasing to pound. Strain through a
sieve, spread the forcemeat on a dish, and keep it on ice until the
next day.</p>

<p>Next day pound the forcemeat again for a few minutes, and
add to it, little by little, one and one-half pints of cream.</p>

<p>Test as before, and rectify if necessary, either by adding
cream or by thickening with the white of an egg.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="200—Chicken Forcemeat for Galantines, Pies and Terrines"><a id="rcp.200"
 >200—CHICKEN FORCEMEAT FOR GALANTINES, PIES <span class="nw">AND TERRINES</span></a></h3>

<p>The exact weight of chicken-meat used as the base of this
forcemeat determines the quantities of its other ingredients.
Thus the weight of meat afforded by a fowl weighing four lbs. is
estimated at twenty oz. after deducting the fillets which are
always reserved. Hence the quantities for the forcemeat are
regulated <span class="nw">thus:—</span></p>

<p>Chicken-meat, twenty oz.; lean pork, eight oz.; fillet of veal,
<a id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eight oz.; fresh, fat bacon, thirty oz.; whole eggs, five; spiced
salt, two oz.; brandy, one-fifth pint.</p>

<p>Chop up, either together or apart, the chicken-meat, the veal,
the pork, and the bacon. Put all these into the mortar, pound
them very finely with the seasoning, add the eggs consecutively,
and, last of all, pour in the brandy.</p>

<h4 class="subhead" title="">Remarks</h4>

<p>1. The quantity of spiced salt varies, a few grammes either
way, according as to whether the atmosphere be dry or damp.</p>

<p>2. According to the purpose of the forcemeat, and with a
view to giving it a finer flavour, one may, subject to the resources
at one’s disposal, add a little raw trimmings of <i>foie gras</i> to it; but
the latter must not, in any case, exceed one-fifth of the forcemeat
in weight.</p>

<p>3. As a rule, forcemeat should always be rubbed through
a sieve so as to ensure its being fine and even.</p>

<p>4. Whether the foie gras be added or not, chicken forcemeat
may always be completed with two or three oz. of chopped truffles
per lb. of its volume.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="201—Game Forcemeat for Pies and Terrines"><a id="rcp.201"
 >201—GAME FORCEMEAT FOR PIES AND TERRINES</a></h3>

<p>This follows the same principles as the chicken forcemeat,
<i>i.e.</i>, the weight of the game-meat determines the quantities of the
other ingredients. The proportions are precisely the same as
above as regards the veal, the pork, the bacon, and the seasoning.
The procedure is also the same, while the appended remarks
likewise apply.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="202—Gratin Forcemeat for Ordinary Hot, Raised Pies"><a id="rcp.202"
 >202—GRATIN FORCEMEAT FOR ORDINARY HOT, <span class="nw">RAISED PIES</span></a></h3>

<p>Put into a sautépan containing one oz. of very hot butter, one-half lb. of fresh, fat bacon, cut into large cubes, brown quickly,
and drain on a dish.</p>

<p>Quickly brown in the same butter one-half lb. of fillet of veal
cut like the bacon and drain in the same way.</p>

<p>Now rapidly brown one-half lb. of pale, calf’s liver, also cut
into large cubes. Put the veal and the bacon back into the sautépan
with the liver, add the necessary quantity of salt and pepper,
two oz. of mushroom parings, one oz. of truffle parings (raw if
possible), chopped shallots, a sprig of thyme, and a fragment of
bay. Put the whole on the fire for two minutes, drain the bacon,
the veal, and the liver, and put the gravy aside. Swill the sautépan
with one-quarter pint of Madeira.</p>

<p><a id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Pound the bacon, veal, and liver quickly and finely, while
adding consecutively six oz. of butter, the yolks of six eggs, the
gravy that has been put aside, one-third pint of cold, reduced
Espagnole, and the Madeira used for swilling.</p>

<p>Strain through a sieve, place in a tureen, and smooth with
the wooden spoon.</p>

<p>N.B.—To make a <a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a> forcemeat with game, substitute
for the veal that game-meat which may happen to be required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="203—Pike Forcemeat for Quenelles à la Lyonnaise"><a id="rcp.203"
 >203—PIKE FORCEMEAT FOR QUENELLES <span class="nw">A LA LYONNAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Forcemeats prepared with the flesh of the pike are extremely
delicate. Subject to circumstances, they may be prepared
according to any one of the three formulæ (Nos. <a href="#rcp.193">193</a>, <a href="#rcp.194">194</a>, <a href="#rcp.195">195</a>).
There is another excellent method of preparing this forcemeat
which I shall submit here, as it is specially used for the preparation
of pike forcemeat à la Lyonnaise.</p>

<p>Pound in a mortar one lb. of the meat of a pike, without the
skin or bones; combine with this one-half lb. of stiff frangipan,
season with salt and nutmeg, pass through a sieve, and put
back into the mortar.</p>

<p>Vigorously work the forcemeat in order to make it cohere,
and gradually add to it one-half lb. of melted beef-fat. The
whole half-pound, however, need not necessarily be beef-fat;
beef-marrow or butter may form part of it in the proportion of
half the weight of the beef-fat.</p>

<p>When the forcemeat is very fine and smooth, withdraw it from
the mortar and place it in a bowl surrounded with ice until
wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="204—Special Stuffings for Fish"><a id="rcp.204"
 >204—SPECIAL STUFFINGS FOR FISH</a></h3>

<p>These preparations diverge slightly from the forcemeats
given above, and they are of two kinds. They are used to
stuff such fish as mackerel, herring, shad, &amp;c., to which they
lend a condimentary touch that makes these fish more agreeable
to the taste, and certainly more digestible.</p>

<p><i>First Method.</i>—Put into a bowl four oz. of raw, chopped milt,
two oz. of bread-crumb, steeped in milk and well pressed, and
one and one-half oz. of the following fine herbs, mixed in equal
quantities and finely <span class="nw">chopped:—</span>Chives, parsley, chervil, shallots,
sweet basil, half a garlic clove (crushed), then two whole
eggs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Chop up all these ingredients together so as to mix them
thoroughly.</p>

<p><i>Second Method.</i>—Put into a bowl four oz. of bread-crumb
<a id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>steeped in milk and well pressed; one-half oz. of onion and one-half oz. of chopped shallots, slightly cooked in butter, and cold;
one oz. of raw mushrooms, chopped and well pressed in a towel;
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley; a piece of garlic the size of a
pea, crushed; salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and two eggs.</p>

<p>Mix it as above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="205—Forcemeat Balls or Quenelles"><a id="rcp.205"
 >205—FORCEMEAT BALLS OR QUENELLES</a></h3>

<p><i>Divers ways of Moulding and Poaching them.</i>—Whatever
be the required size or shape of quenelles there are four ways of
making <span class="nw">them:—</span>(1) By rolling them; (2) by moulding them with
a spoon; (3) by forming them with a piping-bag; (4) by moulding
them by hand into the shape of a kidney.</p>

<p>1. <i>To roll quenelles</i> it is necessary to keep the forcemeat
somewhat stiff, and therefore this process could not well apply to
the <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeats. Place one-quarter lb. of forcemeat,
when ready, on a floured board, and, with hands covered in flour,
roll the preparation until it has lengthened itself into the form of
a sausage, the thickness of which depends upon the required size
of the intended quenelles.</p>

<p>Cut up the sausage of forcemeat laterally with a floured
knife, and roll each section with the finger-ends until the
length it assumes is thrice that of its diameter. The balls
should be put aside on a floured tray as soon as they are made.</p>

<p><i>The Poaching of Rolled Quenelles.</i>—When all the forcemeat
has been used up, the balls are gently tilted into a saucepan
containing boiling, salted water, so calculated in quantity
as to allow of their not being too tightly squeezed. The
saucepan is covered and kept on the side of the fire until all
the balls have risen to the surface and are almost out of the
water. They are then removed with a skimmer and placed in
a bowl of cold water.</p>

<p>At last, when they have properly cooled, they are carefully
drained on a cloth and put aside on a dish until required.</p>

<p>When the quenelles are needed for immediate use it would
be better not to cool them.</p>

<p>2. <i>To Mould Quenelles with a Spoon.</i>—This method may
be applied to all forcemeats, and allows of the balls being
much softer, as the forcemeat need not be so stiff. First, butter
the sautépan or the tray, whereon the balls are to be laid, by
means of a brush, and let the butter cool.</p>

<p>Put the sautépan on the table in front and a little to the
right of one; on the left, place the sautépan or bowl containing
the forcemeat, and on the further side of the buttered sautépan
<a id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there should be a receptacle containing hot water, into
which the spoon used for moulding is inserted. For ordinary
quenelles two coffee-spoons are used, one of which is kept in
the hot water as stated above. Now, with the other held in
the left hand, take up a little of the forcemeat (just enough to
fill the spoon); withdraw the second spoon from the hot water
and place it, with its convex side uppermost, on the other spoon.</p>

<p>This smoothens the upper surface of the forcemeat. Now,
with the help of the second spoon, remove the whole of the
contents of the first spoon, and overturn the second spoon on the
spot in the tray or sautépan which the ball is intended to
occupy. The second spoon, being at once moist and hot,
allows the forcemeat to leave it quite easily in the shape of a
large olive. Renew this operation until the whole of the forcemeat
has been used.</p>

<p><i>The Poaching of Spoon-moulded Quenelles.</i>—When all the
balls have been moulded, place the tray on the side of the
stove and pour enough boiling, salted water over them to
moisten them abundantly. Leave them to poach, and from
time to time move the tray; then, when they have swollen sufficiently
and seem soft and firm to the touch, drain them. If
they are to be used at once they should be placed directly in the
sauce. If they have been prepared in advance, it would be
well to cool them as directed under rolled quenelles.</p>

<p>3. <i>To Form Quenelles with a Piping-bag.</i>—This process
is especially recommended for small, fine, and light forcemeat
balls intended for soup garnish. For, besides being extremely
quick, it allows of making them in any desirable size or shape.</p>

<p>Butter a tray or a sautépan, and leave to cool. Put the
forcemeat into a bag fitted with a pipe at its narrowest end.
The pipe may be grooved or smooth, and its size must be in
accordance with that intended for the proposed balls. Now
squeeze out the latter, proceeding in the usual way and laying
them very closely.</p>

<p><i>The Poaching of Quenelles made by the above Process,
with ordinary or <a href="#g_mousseline">Mousseline</a> Forcemeat.</i>—These quenelles are
poached in exactly the same way as the spoon-moulded ones.</p>

<p><i>The Poaching of Godiveau Quenelles made with a
Piping-bag.</i>—These quenelles or balls are laid on a piece of
fine, buttered paper, which in its turn is placed upon a buttered
tray. The godiveau must not be too stiff, and the balls are
laid by means of the piping-bag side by side and slightly
touching one another. When the tray is covered push it into
a very moderate oven for a few minutes. The balls are poached
<a id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when a thin dew of grease may be seen to glisten on their
surfaces. On the appearance of this dew withdraw them from
the oven and overturn the tray, carefully, upon a marble slab,
taking care that the tray does not press at all upon the balls,
lest it crush them. When the latter are nearly cold the paper
which covers them is taken off with caution, and all that
remains to be done is to put them carefully away on a dish
until they are wanted.</p>

<p>4. <i>To Mould Forcemeat with the Fingers.</i>—This excellent
process is as expedient as that of the bag, and it produces
beautifully shaped balls. Place on the edge of a table, in front
of one, a saucepan three-quarters full of boiling, salted water,
the handle of the receptacle being turned to the far side. Now
take a piece of string one yard in length, double it over, and
tie the free ends to a weight of two lbs., letting the two strands
twist round each other.</p>

<p>This done, there should be a loop at the top of the string.
Put this loop round the handle of the saucepan, and draw
the string diametrically across the latter, letting the weight pull
the string tightly down on the side opposite to the handle.
When this has been effected the operator, with his left hand,
takes some of the forcemeat, smoothening it with a spoon,
and, placing the spoon near the string with his right, first
finger, he removes from its extremity a portion of the preparation
about equal to the intended size of the balls. This portion
of the forcemeat remaining suspended on his first finger, the
operator now scrapes the latter across the string, and the ball
falls beneath into the saucepan containing the water. When
all the stuffing has been moulded in this way the saucepan is
placed on the fire to complete the poaching of the balls, and
the precautions indicated in the preceding processes are observed.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="206—Ordinary Royale"><a id="rcp.206"
 >206—ORDINARY ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Put one oz. of chervil into one pint of boiling consommé,
cover the saucepan, and let infusion proceed away from the
fire for twenty minutes. Now pour this infusion over two
eggs and six yolks, beaten briskly in a basin, and mix with
the whisk. Strain through muslin, and carefully remove therefrom
the froth that has formed. Pour into buttered moulds;
poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, as in the case of cream, and take great
care that the water in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> does not boil.</p>

<p>According to the way in which the royale is to be divided,
it may be poached either in large or small “Charlotte”
moulds; but the latter, large and small alike, must be well
buttered.</p>

<p>If the preparation be put into large moulds, thirty-five or
forty minutes should be allowed for poaching; if, on the other
hand, the moulds are small, about fifteen minutes would suffice.</p>

<p>Always let the royale cool in the moulds.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="207—Deslignac or Cream Royale"><a id="rcp.207"
 >207—DESLIGNAC OR CREAM ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one pint of thin cream, and pour it, little by little,
over one egg and six yolks, well whisked in a basin. Season
with a little salt and nutmeg, strain through muslin, and, for
the poaching, follow the directions given above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="208—Chicken Royale"><a id="rcp.208"
 >208—CHICKEN ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound three oz. of cooked white chicken-meat, and
add thereto three tablespoonfuls of cold Béchamel. Put this
paste in a bowl, season with a little salt and a dash of nutmeg,
dilute with one-fifth pint of cream, and strain through tammy.</p>

<p>Thicken this preparation with one egg and the yolks of three,
<a id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and poach in small or large moulds, in accordance with the
procedure already described.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="209—Game Royale"><a id="rcp.209"
 >209—GAME ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound three oz. of the cooked meat of that game
which gives its name to the preparation, and add three tablespoonfuls
of cold Espagnole Sauce and one-fifth pint of rich
cream, in small quantities at a time. Warm the seasoning with
a very little cayenne, strain through tammy, thicken with one
egg and three yolks, and poach as before.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="210—Fish Royale"><a id="rcp.210"
 >210—FISH ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Stew in butter four oz. of fillet of sole cut into cubes, or
the same quantity of any other fish suited to the nature of
the intended soup. Cool, pound finely, and add, little by
little, two tablespoonfuls of cold Béchamel and one-quarter pint
of cream. Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg, and strain
through tammy. Thicken by means of the yolks of five eggs,
and poach in large or small moulds.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="211—Carrot or Crécy Royale"><a id="rcp.211"
 >211—CARROT OR CRÉCY ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Stew gently in butter five oz. of the red part only of carrots.
Cool, crush in a mortar, and gradually add two tablespoonfuls
of Béchamel and one-fifth pint of rich cream. Season with
table-salt and a pinch of castor sugar, and deepen the tint of
the royale with a few drops of vegetable red. Strain through
tammy, thicken with one egg and four yolks, put into moulds,
and poach.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="212—Fresh Peas or St. Germain Royale"><a id="rcp.212"
 >212—FRESH PEAS OR <span class="nw">ST. GERMAIN</span> ROYALE</a></h3>

<p>Cook one-half lb. of fresh, small peas in boiling water with
a bunch of chervil and a few leaves of fresh mint. Pass
through a sieve, and dilute the resulting purée (in a saucepan)
with two-fifths of its volume of the liquor it has been cooked
in and one-fifth of cream. Add a little sugar, the necessary
salt, one egg, and two yolks. Pass through a fine strainer,
and poach in well-buttered moulds.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="213—Various Royales"><a id="rcp.213"
 >213—VARIOUS ROYALES</a></h3>

<p>Royales may also be made with leeks, celery, &amp;c., the
procedure being as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Finely mince six or seven oz. of the chosen vegetable; stew
<a id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the same gently and thoroughly in butter, and strain through
tammy. Add to the resulting purée three tablespoonfuls of
Béchamel, one-fifth pint of cream, two eggs, and four yolks.
Put into large or small moulds, and poach.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—In order that these royales may have the required
delicacy, I should urge the reader not to exceed the
prescribed quantities of eggs and yolks, these being so calculated
as to exactly produce the density required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="214—The Dividing-up of Royales"><a id="rcp.214"
 >214—THE DIVIDING-UP OF ROYALES</a></h3>

<p>When the poaching is done take the mould or moulds out
of water, and leave the royale to cool in them. Do not turn out
the moulds whilst the preparation is hot, as it would surely
scatter. It only assumes the necessary solidity for being
divided up by means of the aggregation and contraction of its
various constituents during the cooling process.</p>

<p><em>If the royale has been poached in small moulds</em>, slightly trim
the cylinders of <i>royale</i>, divide them up laterally into discs,
and stamp them uniformly with a plain or indented fancy
cutter.</p>

<p><em>If the royale has been poached in large moulds</em>, withdraw it
from these, and place it on a serviette; trim the tops, cut into
half-inch slices, and stamp with small, fancy cutters of different
shapes. These little divisions of <i>royale</i> must always be stamped
very neatly and quite regularly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="215—Chiffonade" id="g_chiffonade"><a id="rcp.215"
 >215—CHIFFONADE</a></h3>

<p>The name “<i>Chiffonade</i>” is given to a mince of sorrel or
lettuce, intended as a complement for such soups as “Potage
de santé,” “le Germiny,” &amp;c., or various clear consommés like
“Julienne.”</p>

<p>To prepare <i>Chiffonade</i>, first carefully shred the sorrel or
lettuce, and remove therefrom all the leaf-ribs. Carefully wash
the leaves, and squeeze the latter tightly between the fingers
of the left hand and the table. Now cut them into fine strips
with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>If the chiffonade be intended for a consommé, add it to the
latter half an hour before dishing up; it is thus actually cooked
in the soup itself. If, as is most often the case, it be intended
for a thick soup, it is better to let it melt well in butter, to
moisten it with a little consommé, and to let it boil for ten
minutes before adding it to the soup.</p>

<p>Whatever the purpose be for which it is made, <i>chiffonade</i>
should always be prepared with very tender sorrel or lettuce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="216—Directions for Soup with Pastes"><a id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.216"
 >216—DIRECTIONS FOR SOUP WITH PASTES</a></h3>

<p>Vermicelli and the various Italian pastes should measure
about three oz. per quart of consommé. They should first
be thrown into boiling, salted water, where they are left to
poach for three minutes, whereupon they are drained, cooled,
and their cooking is completed in the consommé.</p>

<p>The parboiling of these pastes is necessary in order to get
rid of the little agglomerations of flour which adhere to them,
and which would otherwise make the consommé cloudy.</p>

<p>Tapioca, sago, salep, &amp;c., should also be apportioned at
about three oz. per quart. But this is only an average, for the
quality of this kind of products varies greatly, and it is best
to choose the goods of an excellent maker, and, in order to
avoid surprises, to abide by that choice.</p>

<p>These products need no parboiling; they are merely
sprinkled into the boiling consommé while stirring the latter,
and they are left to cook until the soup is quite clear. The
boiling should be gentle, and the scum should be removed as
often as it forms.</p>

<p>The time allowed for cooking naturally varies in accordance
with the quality of the goods, but the absolute transparency
of the consommé is an infallible sign of its having
been completed.</p>

<p>Brazilian, Japanese, and other pearls are used in the same
quantities, but they should poach for thirty minutes if required
to be very transparent.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="217—Threaded Eggs"><a id="rcp.217"
 >217—THREADED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Beat up three eggs in a bowl, season with salt and pepper,
and strain through a sieve. Now pour the eggs into a fine
strainer, hold same over a sautépan containing some boiling
consommé, and shift it about in such wise as to let the egg
fall in threads into the boiling liquid beneath, and thus immediately
coagulate. Drain the egg-threads very carefully lest
they break.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="218—Profiterolles for Soups" id="g_profiterolles"><a id="rcp.218"
 >218—PROFITEROLLES FOR SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>These consist of little <a href="#g_choux">choux</a> about the size of a large hazel-nut,
stuffed with some kinds of purée, such as that of <i>foie gras</i>
with cream, or of chicken, or of vegetables, &amp;c. Four <i>profiterolles</i>
should be allowed for each person.</p>

<p>To make <i>profiterolles</i>, put a few tablespoonfuls of “<i>pâte
à choux</i>” without sugar (No. <a href="#rcp.2374">2374</a>) into a piping-bag fitted with
<a id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a smooth pipe, whose orifice should be about one-quarter inch
in diameter. Squeeze out portions of the preparation on to a
tray, so as to form balls about the size of a small hazel-nut;
<i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> by means of beaten egg applied with a fine brush, and
cook in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>Do not take the <i>profiterolles</i> from the oven until they are
quite dry.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="219—Potato Croquettes"><a id="rcp.219"
 >219—POTATO CROQUETTES</a></h3>

<p>Cook quickly in salted water two lb. of peeled and quartered
potatoes. As soon as they seem soft to the finger, drain them,
place them in the front of the oven for a few minutes in order
to dry them, and then tilt them into a sieve lying on a cloth,
and press them through the former without rubbing.</p>

<p>Place the purée in a sautépan; season with salt, pepper,
and nutmeg; add one oz. of butter, and dry; <i>i.e.</i>, stir over a
brisk fire until the purée becomes a consistent paste.</p>

<p>Take off the fire, complete with the yolks of three eggs,
well mixed with the rest, and turn the paste out on to a buttered
dish, taking care to spread it in a rather thin layer, so as to
precipitate its cooling. Butter the surface to prevent the preparation’s
drying.</p>

<p>To make croquettes, equal portions of this paste, <i>i.e.</i>, portions
weighing about one and one-half oz. of it, are rolled on
a flour-dusted board into the shape of a cork, a ball, or a
quoit. These are now dipped into an <i>Anglaise</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.174">174</a>) and
rolled in bread-crumbs or raspings, the latter being well patted
on to the surface of the <i>croquettes</i>, lest they should fall into
the frying fat. Let the patting also avail for finishing off the
selected shape of the objects. These are then plunged into
hot fat, where they should remain until they have acquired a
fine, golden colour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="220—Dauphine Potatoes"><a id="rcp.220"
 >220—DAUPHINE POTATOES</a></h3>

<p>Prepare as above the required quantity of paste, and add
thereto per lb. six oz. of pâte à choux without sugar (No. <a href="#rcp.2374">2374</a>).</p>

<p>Mix the two constituents thoroughly.</p>

<p>Dauphine potatoes are moulded in the shape of small
cylinders, and they are treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’Anglaise</i></a>, like the <i>croquettes</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="221—Duchesse Potatoes"><a id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.221"
 >221—DUCHESSE POTATOES</a></h3>

<p>These are the same as the <i>croquettes</i>, though they are
differently treated. They are made on a floured board in the
shape of diminutive cottage-loaves, little shuttle-shaped loaves,
small quoits, and lozenges or rectangles. They are <i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i> with
beaten egg, and when their shape is that of quoits, rectangles,
or lozenges, they are streaked by means of a small knife.</p>

<p>After this operation, which is to prevent the <i><a href="#g_gild">gilding</a></i> from
blistering, they are baked in the oven for a few minutes previous
to being used in dressing the dishes they accompany.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="222—Marquise Potatoes"><a id="rcp.222"
 >222—MARQUISE POTATOES</a></h3>

<p>Take one lb. of <i>croquette</i> paste and add thereto six oz. of
very red, reduced tomato-purée. Pour this mixture into a bag
fitted with a large, grooved pipe, and squeeze it out upon a
baking-tray in shapes resembling large <a href="#g_meringue">meringues</a>.</p>

<p>Slightly <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> their surfaces with beaten egg, and put them
into the oven for a few minutes before using them to dress the
dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="223—Ordinary or Dry Duxelle"><a id="rcp.223"
 >223—ORDINARY OR DRY DUXELLE</a></h3>

<p>The uses of Duxelle are legion, and it is prepared <span class="nw">thus:—</span>Slightly
fry one teaspoonful of onions in one tablespoonful of
butter and oil mixed. Add to this four tablespoonfuls of mushroom
stalks and parings, chopped and well pressed in a towel
with the view of expelling their vegetable moisture. Stir over
a brisk fire until the latter has completely evaporated; season
with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and one coffeespoonful of well-chopped
parsley, mixing the whole thoroughly.</p>

<p>Transfer to a bowl, cover with a piece of white, buttered
paper, and put aside until wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="224—Duxelle for Stuffed Vegetables (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, &amp;c.)"><a id="rcp.224"
 >224—DUXELLE FOR STUFFED VEGETABLES <span class="nw">(Tomatoes, Mushrooms, &amp;c.)</span></a></h3>

<p>Put six tablespoonfuls of dry duxelle into a small stewpan,
and add thereto three tablespoonfuls of half-glaze sauce containing
plenty of tomato, crushed garlic the size of a pea, and
two tablespoonfuls of white wine. Set to simmer until the
required degree of consistence is reached.</p>

<p>N.B.—A tablespoonful of fine, fresh bread-crumbs may be
added to the duxelle in order to thicken it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="225—Duxelle for Garnishing Small Pies, Onions, Cucumbers, etc."><a id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.225"
 >225—DUXELLE FOR GARNISHING SMALL PIES, ONIONS, CUCUMBERS, ETC.</a></h3>

<p>To four tablespoonfuls of dry duxelle add four tablespoonfuls
of ordinary pork forcemeat (No. <a href="#rcp.196">196</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="226—Maintenon (preparation used in stuffing preparations à la Maintenon)"><a id="rcp.226"
 >226—MAINTENON (preparation used in stuffing preparations à la Maintenon)</a></h3>

<p>Put one pint of Béchamel into a vegetable-pan with one-half
pint of Soubise (No. <a href="#rcp.104">104</a>), and reduce to half while stirring
over a brisk fire. Thicken, away from the fire, by means of the
yolks of five eggs, and add four tablespoonfuls of minced mushrooms,
either cooked in the ordinary way or stewed in butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="227—Matignon"><a id="rcp.227"
 >227—MATIGNON</a></h3>

<p>This preparation serves chiefly for covering certain large
joints of butcher’s meat, or fowl, to which it imparts an appropriate
flavour. It is made as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Finely mince two
medium carrots (the red part only), two onions, and two sticks
of celery taken from the heart. Add one tablespoonful of raw
lean ham, cut <i><a href="#g_paysanne">paysanne-fashion</a></i>, a sprig of thyme, and half
a leaf of bay, crushed.</p>

<p>Stew in butter, and finally swill the saucepan with two
tablespoonfuls of Madeira.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="228—Mirepoix" id="g_mirepoix"><a id="rcp.228"
 >228—MIREPOIX</a></h3>

<p>The purpose of Mirepoix in culinary preparations is the
same as that of Matignon, but its mode of use is different.</p>

<p>Its constituents are the same as those of the Matignon, but
instead of being minced they are cut up into more or less fine
dice, in accordance with the use for which the preparation is
intended.</p>

<p>Instead of the ham, fresh and slightly-salted breast of pork
may be used, while both the ham and the bacon may be excluded
under certain circumstances.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="229—Fine or Bordelaise Mirepoix"><a id="rcp.229"
 >229—FINE OR BORDELAISE MIREPOIX</a></h3>

<p>Coarse Mirepoix, which are added to certain preparations
in order to lend these the proper flavour, are generally made
immediately before being used, but this is not so in the case
of the finer Mirepoix, which chiefly serves as an adjunct to
crayfish and lobsters. This is made in advance, and as
<span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p><a id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Cut into dice four oz. of the red part only of carrots, the
same quantity of onion, and one oz. of parsley stalks. In
order that the Mirepoix may be still finer, these ingredients
may now be chopped, but in this case it is advisable to thoroughly
press them in a corner of a towel, so as to squeeze out
their vegetable moisture, the mere process of stewing not being
sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<p>Should this water be allowed to remain in the Mirepoix,
more particularly if the latter must be kept some time, it would
probably give rise to mustiness or fermentation.</p>

<p>Put the ingredients into a small stewpan with one and one-half oz. of butter and a little powdered thyme and bay, and
stew until all are well cooked. This done, turn the preparation
out into a small bowl, heap it together with the back of a
fork, cover it with a piece of white, buttered paper, and put
aside until wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="230—Various Salpicons"><a id="rcp.230"
 >230—VARIOUS SALPICONS</a></h3>

<p>This term stands for a certain preparatory method applied to
a series of preparations.</p>

<p>Salpicons are <i>simple</i> or <i>compound</i>. Simple if they only contain
one product, such as the meat of a fowl, or of game,
butcher’s meat, foie gras, various fish, ham or tongue, mushrooms,
truffles, &amp;c. Compound if they consist of two or more of
the above-mentioned ingredients which may happen to combine
suitably.</p>

<p><i>The preparatory method</i> consists in cutting the various ingredients
into dice.</p>

<p><i>The series of preparations</i> arises from the many possible combinations
of the products, each particular combination bearing
its own name.</p>

<p>Thus Salpicons may be Royal, Financier, Chasseur, Parisien,
Montglas, &amp;c.; of whichever kind, however, Salpicons are
always incorporated with a vehicular sauce which is in accordance
with their constituents.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="231—Batter for Various Fritters"><a id="rcp.231"
 >231—BATTER FOR VARIOUS FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Put into a bowl one lb. of sifted flour, one-quarter oz. of salt,
one tablespoonful of oil or melted butter, and the necessary
quantity of barely lukewarm water. If the batter is to be used at
once mix the ingredients by turning them over and over without
stirring with the spoon, for this would give the preparation an
elasticity which would prevent its adhering to immersed solids.
Should the batter be prepared beforehand, however, it may be
<a id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stirred, since it loses its elasticity when left to stand any length
of time.</p>

<p>Before using it add the whites of two eggs whisked to a froth.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="232—Batter for Vegetables"><a id="rcp.232"
 >232—BATTER FOR VEGETABLES (Salsify, <span class="nw">Celery, &amp;c.)</span></a></h3>

<p>Put one lb. of sifted flour into a bowl with one-quarter oz. of
salt and two tablespoonfuls of oil or melted butter. Dilute with
one egg and the necessary quantity of cold water. Keep this
batter somewhat thin, do not stir it, and let it rest for a few
hours before using.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="233—Batter for Fruit and Flower Fritters"><a id="rcp.233"
 >233—BATTER FOR FRUIT AND FLOWER FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Put one lb. of flour into a bowl with one-quarter oz. of salt
and two tablespoonfuls of oil or melted butter. Dilute gradually
with one-quarter pint of beer and a little tepid water.</p>

<p>When about to use the batter mix therewith the whites of two
eggs whisked to a froth.</p>

<p>N.B.—Keep this batter thin, if anything, and above all do
not stir overmuch.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="234—Batter for Oven-glazed Fruit Fritters"><a id="rcp.234"
 >234—BATTER FOR OVEN-GLAZED FRUIT FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Mix one lb. of flour with two tablespoonfuls of oil, a grain of
salt, two eggs (added one after the other), the necessary quantity
of water, and one oz. of sugar. Keep this preparation in a lukewarm
place to let it ferment, and stir it with a wooden spoon before
using it to immerse the solids.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Batter for fruit fritters may contain a few tablespoonfuls
of brandy, in which case an equal quantity of the water
must be suppressed.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="235—Provençale (preparation for stuffing cutlets à la Provençale)"><a id="rcp.235"
 >235—PROVENÇALE (preparation for stuffing cutlets <span class="nw">à la Provençale)</span></a></h3>

<p>Put one pint of Béchamel into a vegetable-pan and reduce it
until it has become quite dense. Thicken it with the yolks of
four eggs, and finish it away from the fire with a crushed piece of
garlic as large as a pea, and one-quarter lb. of grated cheese.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="236—The Preparation of Soups"><a id="rcp.236"
 >236—THE PREPARATION OF SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>The nutritious liquids known under the name of Soups are of
comparatively recent origin. Indeed, as they are now served,
they do not date any further back than the early years of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The soups of old cookery were, really, complete dishes,
wherein the meats and vegetables used in their preparation were
assembled. They, moreover, suffered from the effects of the
general confusion which reigned in the menus of those days.
These menus seem to have depended in no wise, for their items,
upon the progressive satisfaction of the consumers’ appetites,
and a long procession of dishes was far more characteristic of the
meal than their judicious order and diversity.</p>

<p>In this respect, as in so many others, Carême was the reformer,
and, if he were not, strictly speaking, the actual initiator
of the changes which ushered in our present methods, he certainly
had a large share in the establishment of the new theories.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it took his followers almost a century to bring
soups to the perfection of to-day, for modern cookery has replaced
those stodgy dishes of yore by comparatively simple and savoury
preparations which are veritable wonders of delicacy and taste.
Now, my attention has been called to the desirability of drawing
up some sort of classification of soups, if only with the view of
obviating the absurdity of placing such preparations as are indiscriminately
called Bisque, Purée, Cullis, or Cream under the
same head. Logically, each preparation should have its own
special formula, and it is impossible to admit that one and the
same can apply to all.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the terms <i>Veloutés</i> and
<i>Creams</i>, whose introduction into the vocabulary of cookery
is comparatively recent, are peculiarly well suited to supplant
those of <i>Bisque</i> and <i>Cullis</i>, which are steadily becoming
obsolete, as well as that too vulgar term <i>Purée</i>. Considerations
<a id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of this kind naturally led me to a new classification of soups, and
this I shall disclose later.</p>

<p>I shall not make any lengthy attempt here to refute the arguments
of certain autocrats of the dinner-table who, not so many
years ago, urged the total abolition of soups. I shall only
submit to their notice the following quotation from Grimod de la
Reynière<!-- TN: original reads "Regnière" -->, one of our most illustrious gastronomists: “Soup is
to a dinner what the porch or gateway is to a building,” that is to
say, it must not only form the first portion thereof, but it must be
so devised as to convey some idea of the whole to which it belongs;
or, after the manner of an overture in a light opera, it
should divulge what is to be the dominant phrase of the melody
throughout.</p>

<p>I am at one with Grimod in this, and believe that soups have
come to stay. Of all the items on a menu, soup is that which
exacts the most delicate perfection and the strictest attention, for
upon the first impression it gives to the diner the success of the
latter part of the meal largely depends.</p>

<p>Soups should be served as hot as possible in very warm plates,
especially in the case of consommés when these have been preceded
by cold hors-d’œuvres.</p>

<p>Hors-d’œuvres are pointless in a dinner, and even when
oysters stand as such they should only be allowed at meals which
include no soup.</p>

<p>Those hors-d’œuvres which consist of various fish, smoked
or in oil, and strongly seasoned salads, leave a disagreeable taste
on the consumer’s palate and make the soup which follows seem
flat and insipid if the latter be not served boiling hot.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Classification of Soups">Classification of Soups</h3>

<p>This includes (1) clear soups, (2) thick soups, (3) special soups
of various kinds, (4) classical vegetable soups, including some
local preparations.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="237—Clear Soups"><a id="rcp.237"
 >237—CLEAR SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>Clear soups, of whatever nature the base thereof may be,
whether butcher’s meat, poultry, game, fish, shell-fish, or
turtle, &amp;c., are made according to one method only. They are
always clear consommés to which has been added a slight garnish
in keeping with the nature of the consommé.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="238—Thick Soups"><a id="png.117" href="#png.117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.238"
 >238—THICK SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>These are divided into three leading classes as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>(1) The Purées, Cullises, or Bisques. (2) Various Veloutés. (3) Various Creams.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Though the three preparations of the first class
are practically the same, and, generally speaking, the Cullises
and the Bisques may be considered as purées of fowl, game,
or shell-fish, it is advisable to distinguish one from another by
giving each a special name of its own.</p>

<p>Thus the word <i>Purée</i> is most suitably applied to any preparation
with a vegetable base. The term <i>Cullis</i> is best fitted to
preparations having either poultry, game, or fish for base,
while bisque, in spite of the fact that in former days it was
applied indiscriminately to purées of shell-fish, poultry, pigeons, &amp;c., distinctly denotes a purée of shell-fish (either lobster, crayfish,
or shrimp, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>In short, it is imperative to avoid all ambiguities and to give
everything its proper name, or, at least, that name which identifies
it most correctly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="239—Purées"><a id="rcp.239"
 >239—PURÉES</a></h3>

<p>Farinaceous vegetables, such as haricot-beans and lentils,
and the floury ones, such as the potato, need no additional
thickening ingredient, since the flour or fecula which they contain
amply suffices for the leason of their purées.</p>

<p>On the other hand, aqueous vegetables like carrots, pumpkins,
turnips, celery, and herbs cannot dispense with a thickening
ingredient, as their purées of themselves do not cohere in
the least.</p>


<p><i>Cohering or Thickening Elements; their Quantities.</i>—In
order to effect the coherence of vegetable purées, either rice,
potato, or bread-crumb cut into dice and fried in butter may be
used.</p>

<p>The proportion of these per pound of vegetables should be
respectively three oz., ten oz., and ten oz. Bread-crumb dice,
prepared as described above, were greatly used in old cookery,
and they lend a mellowness to a purée which is quite peculiar to
them.</p>

<p><i>The Dilution of Purées.</i>—Generally this is done by means of
ordinary white consommé, though in certain cases, as, for instance,
if the soup is a Lenten one, milk is used.</p>

<p><i>The Finishing.</i>—When the purées have been strained and
brought to the required consistence they should be boiled and
stirred. Then they are placed on the side of the fire to simmer
<a id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for twenty-five or thirty minutes. It is at this stage that they are
purified by means of the careful removal of all the scum that
forms on their surface.</p>

<p>When dishing up complete them, away from the fire, with
three oz. of butter per quart of soup, and pass them once more
through a strainer.</p>

<p><i>Purée Garnishes.</i>—These are usually either small fried crusts,
small dice of potato fried in butter, a <i><a href="#g_chiffonade">chiffonade</a></i>, some kind of
little <i><a href="#g_brunoise">brunoise</a></i>, or, more generally, chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="240—Cullises"><a id="rcp.240"
 >240—CULLISES</a></h3>

<p>Cullises have for their base either poultry, game, or fish.</p>

<p><i>The thickening ingredients used</i> <span class="nw"><i>are</i>:—</span></p>

<p><i>For fowl</i>, two or three oz. of rice, or three-quarters pint of
poultry velouté per lb. of fowl.</p>

<p><i>For game</i>, three or four oz. of lentils, or three-quarters pint
of game Espagnole per lb. of game.</p>

<p><i>For fish</i>, a clear panada made up of French bread soaked
in boiling salted milk. Use five oz. of bread and one good pint
of milk per lb. of fish. Having strained and made up the
Cullises, boil them while stirring (except in the case of fish
cullises, which must not boil, and must be served as soon as they
are made), then place them in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> and butter their
surfaces lest a skin should form.</p>

<p>At the last moment complete them with two or three oz.
of butter per quart.</p>

<p>The garnish of poultry or game cullises consists of either
small dice of game or fowl-fillets, which should be kept aside
for the purpose; a fine <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of these fillets, or small quenelles
made from the latter, raw.</p>

<p>The garnish of fish cullis is generally fish-fillets poached in
butter and cut up into small dice or in <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="241—Bisques"><a id="rcp.241"
 >241—BISQUES</a></h3>

<p>The invariable base of Bisques is shell-fish cooked in <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>.</p>

<p>Their thickening ingredients are, or may be, rice, fish
velouté, or crusts of bread fried in butter, the proportion being
three oz. of rice, ten oz. of bread-crusts, or three-quarters pint
of fish velouté per lb. of shell-fish cooked in <i>mirepoix</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.228">228</a>).</p>

<p>When the soup is strained, treat it in precisely the same
way as the cullises.</p>

<p>The garnish consists of small dice of the meat from the
<a id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>shell-fish used. These pieces should have been put aside from
the first.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="242—The Veloutés"><a id="rcp.242"
 >242—THE VELOUTÉS</a></h3>

<p>These differ from the purées, cullises, and bisques in that
their invariable thickening element is a velouté whose preparation
is in harmony with the nature of the ingredients of the soup,
these being either vegetables, poultry, game, fish, or shell-fish.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of the Velouté.</i>—Allow three and one-half oz. of white roux per quart of the diluent. This diluent should
be ordinary consommé for a velouté of vegetables or herbs,
chicken consommé for a poultry velouté, or very clear fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>
for a fish or shell-fish velouté. The procedure is exactly the
same as that described under No. <a href="#rcp.25">25</a> of the leading sauces.</p>

<p><i>The Apportionment of the Ingredients.</i>—In general, the
quantities of each constituent are in the following <span class="nw">proportion:—</span>Velouté,
one-half; the purée of the substance which characterises
the soup, one-quarter; the consommé used to bring the
soup to its proper consistence, one-quarter. In respect of finishing
ingredients, use, for thickening, the yolks of three eggs and
one-fifth pint of cream per quart of soup.</p>

<p>Thus for four quarts of poultry velouté we arrive at the
following <span class="nw">quantities:—</span></p>

<p>Poultry velouté, three pints; purée of fowl obtained from a
cleaned and drawn hen weighing about three lbs., one quart;
consommé for regulating consistence, one quart; leason, twelve
yolks and four-fifths pint of cream.</p>

<p><i>Rules Relative to the Preparation.</i>—If the velouté is to be
of lettuce, chicory, celery, or mixed herbs, these ingredients
are scalded for five minutes, drained, gently stewed in butter,
and added to the prepared velouté in which their cooking is
completed.</p>

<p>If carrots, turnips, onions, &amp;c., are to be treated, finely mince
them, stew them in butter without allowing them to acquire any
colour, and add them to the velouté.</p>

<p>If fowl be the base, cook it in the velouté. This done, withdraw
it, remove the meat, finely pound same, and add it to
the velouté, which is then rubbed through tammy.</p>

<p>In the case of fish the procedure is the same as for fowl.
For game, roast or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sauté</a></i> the selected piece, bone it, finely pound
the meat, and combine the latter with the velouté, which should
then be rubbed through tammy.</p>

<p>For shell-fish, cook these in a <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, finely pound them
together with the latter, add to the velouté, and pass the whole
through tammy.</p>

<p><a id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>The Completing of Velouté.</i>—Having passed the soup
through tammy, bring it to its proper degree of consistence
with the necessary quantity of consommé, boil while stirring,
and place in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>At the last moment finish the soup with the leason and two oz. of butter per quart of liquid.</p>

<p><i>Garnish for Velouté.</i>—In the case of vegetables: <i><a href="#g_chiffonade">Chiffonade</a></i>,
fine <a href="#g_printanier"><i>printaniers</i></a>, or <i><a href="#g_brunoise">brunoise</a></i>.</p>

<p>For fowl and game: The fillets of one or the other, poached
and cut into small dice or in <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>; little quenelles
made with the raw fillets, or either fowl or game royales.</p>

<p>For fish: Small dice or fine <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of fish fillets poached
in butter.</p>

<p>For shell-fish: Small dice of cooked shell-fish meat put aside
for the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—In certain circumstances these garnishes are increased
by means of three tablespoonfuls of poached rice per
quart of the soup.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="243—The Creams"><a id="rcp.243"
 >243—THE CREAMS</a></h3>

<p>Practically speaking, the preparation of the creams is the
same as that of the veloutés, but for the following <span class="nw">exceptions:—</span></p>

<p>1. In all circumstances, <i>i.e.</i>, whatever be the nature of the
soup, velouté is substituted for clear Béchamel.</p>

<p>2. The correct consistence of the soup is got by means of
milk instead of consommé.</p>

<p>3. Creams do not require egg-yolk leasons.</p>

<p>4. They are not buttered, but they are finished with one-fifth
or two-fifths pint of fresh cream per quart.</p>

<p>Creams allow of the same garnishes as the veloutés.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="244—Special Soups and Thickened Consommés"><a id="rcp.244"
 >244—SPECIAL SOUPS AND THICKENED CONSOMMÉS</a></h3>

<p>These are of different kinds, though their preparation
remains the same, and they do not lend themselves to the requirements
of veloutés or creams. I should quote as types of
this class the Ambassador, à l’Américaine, Darblay, Faubonne, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The same holds good with thickened consommés, such as
“Germiny,” “Coquelin,” &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="245—Vegetable Soups"><a id="rcp.245"
 >245—VEGETABLE SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>These soups, of which the “Paysanne” is the radical type,
do not demand very great precision in the apportionment of
<a id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the vegetables of which they are composed; but they need great
care and attention, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The vegetables, in the majority of cases, must undergo a
long stewing in butter, an operation the object of which is to
expel their vegetable moisture and to saturate them with butter.</p>

<p>In respect of others which have a local character, the vegetables
should be cooked with the diluent, without a preparatory
stewing.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="246—Foreign Soups"><a id="rcp.246"
 >246—FOREIGN SOUPS</a></h3>

<p>In the course of Part II. of this work I shall allude to certain
soups which have a foreign origin, and whose use, although it
may not be general, is yet sufficiently common. If only for the
sake of novelty or variety, it is occasionally permissible to poach
upon the preserves of foreign nations; but apart from this
there exist among the recipes of foreigners many which can but
enrich their adopter, besides being generally appreciated.</p>



<h3 class="subhead" title="Braising, Poaching, Sautés, and Poëling"><a id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>2. Braising, Poaching, Sautés, and Poëling.</h3>

<p>Except for the roasts, grills, and fryings, which will be discussed
later, all culinary operations dealing with meat are related
to one of the four following methods: Braising, <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>,
poaching, and <a href="#g_saute_1">sautés</a>.</p>

<p>These four methods of cooking belong, however, to the
sauces, and this explains how it is that the latter hold such a
pre-eminent position in French cookery.</p>

<p>Before devoting any attention to particular formulæ, which
will be given in the second part of this work, it seemed desirable
to me to recapitulate in a general way the theory of each of these
cooking methods. These theories are of paramount importance,
since it is only with a complete knowledge of them that good
results may be obtained by the culinary operator.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="247—Ordinary Braisings"><a id="rcp.247"
 >247—ORDINARY BRAISINGS</a></h3>

<p>Of all the various culinary operations, braisings are the most
expensive and the most difficult. Long and assiduous practice
alone can teach the many difficulties that this mode of procedure
entails, for it is one which demands extraordinary care and
the most constant attention. Over and above the question of
care and that of the quality of meat used, which latter consideration
is neither more nor less important here than in any other
cooking operation, there are also these conditions to be fulfilled
in order that a good braising may be obtained, namely, that
excellent stock should be used in moistening, and that the
braising base be well prepared.</p>

<p><i>Meats that are Braised.</i>—Mutton and beef are braised in the
ordinary way, but veal, lamb, and poultry are braised in a
manner which I shall treat of later.</p>

<p>Meat intended for braising need not, as in the case of roasts,
be that of young beasts. The best for the purpose is that
derived from an animal of three to six years of age in the case
of beef, and one to two years in the case of mutton. Good meat
is rarely procured from animals more advanced than these in
years, and, even so, should it be used, it would not only be
necessary to protract the time of cooking inordinately, but the
resulting food would probably be fibrous and dry.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, meat derived from old or ill-nourished
beasts only answers two purposes in cookery, viz., the preparation
of consommés and that of various kinds of stock.</p>

<p><a id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>The Larding of Meats for Braising.</i>—When the meat to be
braised is ribs or fillet of beef, it is always interlarded, and consequently
never dry if of decent quality. But this is not the
case with the meat of the rumps, or with leg of mutton. These
meats are not sufficiently fat of themselves to allow of prolonged
cooking without their becoming dry. For this reason they are
larded with square strips of bacon fat, which should be as long
as the meat under treatment, and about half an inch thick.
These strips of fat are first seasoned with pepper, nutmeg, and
spices, besprinkled with chopped parsley, and then <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>
for two hours in a little brandy. They should be inserted into
the meat equidistantly by means of special larding needles.
The proportion of fat to the meat should be about three oz.
per lb.</p>

<p><i>To <a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a> Braisings.</i>—Larded or not, the meats intended
for braising gain considerably from being <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> for a few
hours in the wines which are to supply their moistening and
the aromatics constituting the base of their liquor. Before doing
this season them with salt, pepper, and spices, rolling them
over and over in these in order that they may absorb the seasoning
thoroughly. Then place them in a receptacle just large
enough to contain them, between two litters of aromatics, which
will be detailed hereafter; cover them with the wine which forms
part of their braising-liquor, and which is generally a white or
red “vin ordinaire,” in the proportion of one-quarter pint per lb. of meat, and leave them to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for about six hours,
taking care to turn them over three or four times during that
period.</p>

<p><i>The Aromatics or Base of the Braising.</i>—These are thickly
sliced and fried carrots and onions, in the proportion of one oz.
per lb. of meat, one faggot, including one garlic clove and one
and one-half oz. of fresh, <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> bacon-rind.</p>

<p><i>To Fry, Prepare, and Cook Braised Meat.</i>—Having sufficiently
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> the meat, drain it on a sieve for half an hour,
and wipe it dry with a clean piece of linen. Heat some clarified
fat of white consommé in a thick saucepan of convenient size, or
a braising-pan, and when it is sufficiently hot put the meat in
the saucepan and let it acquire colour on all sides. The object
of this operation is to cause a contraction of the pores of the
meat, thereby surrounding the latter with a species of cuirass,
which prevents the inner juices from escaping too soon and
converting the braising into a boiling process. The frying
should, therefore, be a short or lengthy process according as to
whether the amount of meat to be braised be small or large.</p>

<p><a id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Having properly fried the meat, withdraw it from the
braising-pan, cover it with slices of larding-bacon if it be lean,
and string it. In the case of fillets and ribs of beef, this treatment
may be dispensed with, as they are sufficiently well
supplied with their own fat.</p>

<p>Now pour the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> prepared for the meat into the
braising-pan, and place the meat on a litter composed of the
vegetables the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> contained. Cover the pan and rapidly
reduce the wine therein. When this has assumed the consistency
of syrup add sufficient brown stock to cover the meat (it
being understood that the latter only just conveniently fills the
pan), cover the braising-pan, set to boil, and then put it in a
moderate oven. Let the meat cook until it may be deeply pricked
with a braiding needle without any blood being drawn. At
this stage the first phase of braising, whereof the theory shall be
given hereafter, comes to an end, and the meat is transferred
to another clean utensil just large enough to hold it.</p>

<p>With respect to the cooking liquor, either of the two following
modes of procedure may now be <span class="nw">adopted:—</span></p>

<p>1. If the liquor is required to be clear it need only be
strained, over the meat, through muslin, while the braising-pan
should be placed in the oven, where the cooking may go on
until completed, interrupting it only from time to time in order
to baste the meat. This done, thicken the liquor with arrow-root,
after the manner of an ordinary thickened gravy (No. <a href="#rcp.41">41</a>).</p>

<p>2. If, on the contrary, a sauce be required, the liquor should
be reduced to half before being put back on the meat, and it
is restored to its former volume by means of two-thirds of its
quantity of Espagnole sauce and one-third of tomato purée, or
an equivalent quantity of fresh tomatoes.</p>

<p>The cooking of the meat is completed in this sauce, and
the basting should be carried on as before. When it is cooked—that
is to say, when the point of a knife may easily be thrust
into it without meeting with any resistance whatsoever—it
should be carefully withdrawn from the sauce; the latter should
be again strained through muslin and then left to rest, with a
view to letting the grease settle on the surface.</p>

<p>Carefully remove this grease, and rectify the sauce with a
little excellent stock if it is too thick, or by reduction if it is
too thin.</p>

<p><i>The Glazing of Braised Meat.</i>—Braised meat is glazed in
order to make it more sightly, but this operation is by no means
essential, and it is quite useless when the meat is cut up previous
to being served.</p>

<p><a id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>To glaze meat place it as soon as cooked in the front of the
oven, sprinkle it slightly with its cooking liquor (gravy or
sauce), and push it into the oven so that this liquor may dry.
Being very gelatinous, the latter adheres to the meat, while its
superfluous water evaporates, and thus coats the solid with a
thin film of meat-glaze. This operation is renewed eight or
ten times, whereupon the meat is withdrawn from the oven,
placed on a dish, and covered until it is served.</p>

<p><i>Various Remarks relative to Braising.</i>—When a braised
meat is to be accompanied by vegetables, as in the case of beef
à la mode, these vegetables may either be cooked with the meat
during the second braising phase, after they have been duly
coloured in butter with a little salt and sugar, or they may be
cooked separately with a portion of the braising-liquor. The
first procedure is the better, but it lends itself less to a correct
final dressing. It is, therefore, the operator’s business to decide
according to circumstances which is the more suitable of the
two.</p>

<p>I pointed out above that the cooking of braised meat consists
of two phases, and I shall now proceed to discuss each
of these, so that the reader may thoroughly understand their
processes.</p>

<p>It has been seen that meat, to be braised, must in the first
place be fried all over, and this more particularly when it is
very thick. The object of this operation is to hold in the meat’s
juices, which would otherwise escape from the cut surfaces.
Now, this frying produces a kind of cuirass around the flesh,
which gradually thickens during the cooking process until it
reaches the centre. Under the influence of the heat of the surrounding
liquor the meat fibres contract, and steadily drive the
contained juices towards the centre. Soon the heat reaches the
centre, where, after having effected a decomposition of the juices
therein collected, the latter release the superfluous water they
contain. This water quickly vaporises, and by so doing distends
and separates the tissues surrounding it. Thus, during
this first phase, a concentration of juices takes place in the
centre of the meat. It will now be seen that they undergo an
absolutely different process in the second.</p>

<p>As shown, the disaggregation of the muscular tissue begins
in the centre of the meat as soon as the temperature which
reaches there is sufficiently intense to vaporise the collected
juices. The tension of the vapour given off by the latter perforce
increases by dint of finding no issue; it therefore exerts
considerable pressure upon the tissues, though now its direction
<a id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is the reverse of what it was in the first place, <i>i.e.</i>, from the
centre to the periphery.</p>

<p>Gradually the tissues relax under the pressure and the effects
of cooking, and, the work of disaggregation having gradually
reached the fried surface, the latter also relaxes in its turn and
allows the constrained juices to escape and to mix with the
sauce. At the same time, however, the latter begins to filter
through the meat, and this it does in accordance with a well-known
physical law, namely, capillarity. This stage of the
braising demands the most attentive care. The braising-liquor
is found to be considerably reduced and no longer covers the
meat, for the operation is nearing its end. The bared meat
would, therefore, dry very quickly, if care were not taken to
baste it constantly and to turn it over and over, so that the
whole of the muscular tissue is moistened and thoroughly
saturated with the sauce. By this means the meat acquires that
mellowness which is typical of braisings and distinguishes them
from other preparations.</p>

<p>I should be loth to dismiss this subject before pointing out
two practices in the cooking of braisings which are as common
as they are absolutely wrong. The first of these is the
“<i>pinçage</i>” of the braising base. Instead of laying the fried
meat on a litter of aromatics, likewise fried beforehand, many
operators place the meat, which they often omit to fry, on raw
aromatics at the bottom of the braising-pan. The whole is
sprinkled with a little melted fat, and the aromatics are left to
fry, on one side only, until they begin to burn on the bottom
of the receptacle.</p>

<p>If this operation were properly conducted it might be
tolerated, even though aromatics which are only fried on one
side cannot exude the same savour as those which are fried all
over. But nine times out of ten the frying is too lengthy a
process; from neglect or absent-mindedness the aromatics are
left to burn on the bottom of the pan, and there results a
bitterness which pervades and spoils the whole sauce.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this process of “<i>pinçage</i>” is an absurd
caricature of a method of preparing braisings which was very
common in old cookery, the custom of which was not to prepare
the braising-liquor in advance, but to cook it and its ingredients
simultaneously with the meat to be braised. This method,
though excellent, was very expensive, the meats forming the
base of the braising-liquor consisting of thick slices of raw
ham or veal. The observance of economy, therefore, long ago
compelled cooks to abandon this procedure. But routine has
<a id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>perpetuated the <i>form</i> of the latter without insisting upon the
use of its constituents, which were undoubtedly its essential
part. Routine has even, in certain cases, aggravated the first
error by instituting a habit consisting of substituting bones for
the meats formerly employed—an obviously ridiculous practice.</p>

<p>In the production of ordinary consommé (<a href="#rcp.1">No. 1</a>) we saw that
bones, even when taken from veal, as is customary in the case
of braising-liquor, require, at the very least, ten to twelve hours
of cooking before they can yield all their soluble properties.
As a proof of this it is interesting to note that, if bones undergo
only five or six hours of cooking, and are moistened afresh and
cooked for a further six hours, the liquor of the second cooking
yields more meat-glaze than that of the first; though it must be
admitted that, while the latter is more gelatinous, it has less
savour. But this gelatinous property of bones is no less useful
to braisings than is their savour, since it is the former that
supplies the mellowness, which nothing can replace and without
which the sauce can have no quality.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, the longest time that a braising can cook
is from four to five hours, it follows that, if bones be added
thereto, their properties will scarcely have begun disaggregating
when the meat is cooked. They will, in fact, have yielded but
an infinitesimal portion of these properties; wherefore their
addition to the braising is, to say the least, quite useless.</p>

<p>It now remains to be proved that the above method is bad
from another point of view.</p>

<p>I suppose I need not fear contradiction when I assert that,
in order that a braising may be good, its sauce should be short
and correspondingly substantial; also that the sauce obtained
from a piece of meat moistened with a quart of liquid cannot
be so good as that resulting from the moistening of a pint only.</p>

<p>It is more particularly on this account that I advise a braising
utensil which can only just hold the meat, for since, in the first
stage, the meat is only moistened with the braising-liquor, the
smaller the receptacle may be the less liquor will it require,
and the latter will in consequence be the tastier. Hence, if
bones be added to the braising, the utensil must necessarily be
larger, and a greater quantity of braising-liquor must be used.
But this liquor will not be nearly so savoury as that obtained
from the process I recommend; in fact, it will be but a rather
strong broth, quite unfit for the impregnation of the meat,
and the final result will be a tasteless lump of fibre instead of a
succulent braising.</p>

<p>I must apologise to the reader for my insistence with regard
<a id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to these questions, but their importance is such that success is
beyond reach in the matter of brown sauces and braisings unless
the above details have been thoroughly grasped. Moreover, the
explanations given will afford considerable help in the understanding
of operations which I shall give later; therefore it is
to be hoped that the examination of the theories involved,
however long this has been, will prove of use and assistance.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="248—Braising of White Meats"><a id="rcp.248"
 >248—BRAISING OF WHITE MEATS</a></h3>

<p><i>The braising of white meats</i> as it is now effected in modern
cookery is, strictly speaking, not braising at all, inasmuch as
the cooking is stopped at the close of the first of the two phases
which I mentioned when discussing brown braisings. True,
old cookery did not understand braising in the way that the
modern school does, and under the ancient régime large pieces,
especially of veal, were frequently cooked until they could
almost be scooped with a spoon. This practice has been generally,
though mistakenly, eschewed, but its name survives.</p>

<p>White braisings are made with the neck, the saddle, the loin,
the fillets, the fricandeaus, and the sweet-bread of veal, young
turkeys and fat pullets, and sometimes, though less frequently,
relevés of lamb, hindquarters or saddle. The procedure is the
same for all these meats; the time of cooking alone varies in
accordance with their size. The aromatics are the same as
those of the brown braisings, but the frying of them is optional.</p>

<p>The moistening liquor is brown veal stock (<a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>).</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Except for the veal sweet-bread, which
is always <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> before being braised, the meats or poultry
to be treated may always be slightly stiffened and browned in
butter, on all sides. This is not essential in all cases, but I
think that when they do undergo something of the kind they
dry less quickly. Now place them in a utensil just large enough
to hold them and deep enough to keep the lid from touching
them. Place the aromatics under them and moisten with a little
veal stock; set to boil on a moderate fire, and reduce the veal
stock with the lid on. When this stock has assumed the consistence
of a glaze, add a further similar quantity of fresh stock,
and reduce as before. The third time moisten the veal until it
is half covered, and push the pan into a moderate oven.</p>

<p>The meat needs constant basting while it cooks, in order
to avoid its drying; and, as the stock is very gelatinous, it
forms a coating on the surface which resists the evaporation of
the contained juices; for these, being insufficiently constrained
by the slight frying the meat has undergone, tend to vaporise
under the influence of the heat.</p>

<p><a id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It is for this reason that the stock must be reduced to a
glaze before finally moistening. If the moistening were all
done at once, the liquor would not be sufficiently dense to
form the coating mentioned above, and the meat would consequently
dry on being set to cook.</p>

<p>Braised white meat is known to be cooked when, after having
deeply pricked it with a braiding needle, it exudes an absolutely
colourless liquid. This liquid denotes that the piece is cooked
to the centre, and as a result thereof the blood has decomposed.</p>

<p>There lies the great difference between brown braisings and
white-meat braisings. The latter are practically roasts, and
they should not be made with any but young poultry or meats,
very fat and tender, for they cannot go beyond their correct
time of cooking, which equals that of roasts, without immediately
losing all their quality. A quarter of an hour too much in
the cooking of a kernel of veal weighing about six lbs. is enough
to make the meat dry and unpalatable, and to thoroughly spoil
it, whereas a brown braising cannot be over-cooked, provided
it do not burn.</p>

<p>White braised meats are generally glazed, and this process
is especially recommended for larded pieces, which, though less
common nowadays than formerly, can still claim many
votaries.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="249—Poachings"><a id="rcp.249"
 >249—POACHINGS</a></h3>

<p>However nonsensical it may sound, the best possible definition
of a poaching is a boiling that does not boil. The
term <i>poach</i> is extended to all slow processes of cooking which
involve the use of a liquor, however small. Thus the term
poach applies to the cooking in <i>court-bouillon</i> of large pieces
of turbot and salmon, as well as to fillets of sole cooked with
a little fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, to hot <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> and <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>, cooked in
moulds, to quenelles which are cooked in salted water, to eggs
announced as “poached,” to creams, various royales, &amp;c. It
will readily be seen that among so many different products, the
time allowed for the cooking in each case must differ sometimes
widely from the rest. The treatment of them all, however,
is subject to this unalterable principle, namely, that the
poaching liquor must not boil, though it should reach a degree
of heat as approximate as possible to boiling-point. Another
principle is that large pieces of fish or poultry be set to boil
in cold liquor, after which the latter is brought to the required
temperature as rapidly as possible. The case may be the
same with fillets of sole, or poultry, which are poached almost
<a id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dry; but all other preparations whose mode of cooking is
poaching gain by being immersed in liquor which has reached
the required temperature beforehand.</p>

<p>Having regard to the multitudinous forms and kinds of products
that are poached, it would be somewhat difficult to state
here the details and peculiarities proper to each in the matter
of poaching; I think, therefore, I should do better to leave
these details to the respective recipes of each product, though it
will now be necessary to disclose the way of poaching poultry,
if only with a view to thoroughly acquainting the reader with
the theory propounded above.</p>

<p>Properly prepare the piece of poultry to be poached, and
truss it with its legs folded back alongside of the breast.</p>

<p>If it is to be stuffed, this should be done before trussing.</p>

<p>If it is to be larded or studded, either with truffles, ham,
or tongue, rub it when trussed on the fillets and legs with half
a lemon, and dip the same portions of its body (namely, those
to be larded or studded) for a few moments in boiling white
stock. The object of this operation is to slightly stiffen the
skin, thus facilitating the larding or studding.</p>

<p><i>The Cooking of the Piece of Poultry.</i>—Having stuffed,
larded, or studded it, if necessary, and having, in any case,
trussed it, place it in a receptacle just large enough to hold it,
and moisten with some excellent white stock previously prepared.</p>

<p>Set to boil, skim, put the lid on, and continue the cooking
at a low simmer. It is useless to work too quickly, as the
operation would not be shortened a second by so doing. The
only results would <span class="nw">be:—</span></p>

<p>1. Too violent evaporation, which would reduce the liquor
and disturb its limpidness.</p>

<p>2. The running of a considerable risk of bursting the piece
of poultry, especially when the latter is stuffed.</p>

<p>The fowl, or whatever it may be, is known to be cooked
when, after pricking the thick of the leg close to the “drumstick,”
the issuing liquid is white.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—(<i>a</i>) The need of poaching poultry in a receptacle
just large enough to hold the piece is accounted for as follows:
(1) The piece must be wholly immersed in the stock during the
cooking process. (2) As the liquor used is afterwards served
as an accompanying sauce to the dish, the less there is of it
the more saturated does it become with the juices of the meat,
and, consequently, the better it is.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) (1) The white stock used in poaching should be prepared
beforehand, and be very clear.</p>

<p><a id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>(2) If the piece of poultry were set to cook with the products
constituting the stock, even if these were more than liberally
apportioned, the result would be bad, for inasmuch as a fowl,
for example, can only take one and one-half hours, at the most,
to cook, and the time required for extracting the nutritious and
aromatic principles from the constituents of the stock would
be at least six hours, it follows that the fowl would be cooking
in little more than hot water, and the resulting sauce would
be quite devoid of savour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="250—Poëlings" id="g_poele_1"><a id="rcp.250"
 >250—POËLINGS</a></h3>

<p>Poëlings are, practically speaking, roasts, for the cooking
periods of each are the same, except that the former are cooked
entirely or almost entirely with butter. They represent a simplified
process of old cookery, which consisted in enveloping
the object to be treated, after frying it, in a thick coating of
<i>Matignon</i>. It was then wrapped with thin slices of pork fat,
covered with buttered paper, placed in the oven or on a spit,
and basted with melted butter while it cooked. This done, its
grease was drained away, and the vegetables of the <i>matignon</i>
were inserted in the braising-pan wherein the piece had cooked,
or in a saucepan, and were moistened with excellent Madeira or
highly seasoned stock. Then, when the liquor had thoroughly
absorbed the aroma of the vegetables, it was strained, and its
grease was removed just before dishing up. This excellent
method is worthy of continued use in the case of large pieces
of poultry.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Poëled Meats.</i>—Place in the bottom of a deep
and thick receptacle, just large enough to hold the piece to be
poëled, a layer of raw <i>matignon</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.227">227</a>). The meat or piece
of poultry is placed on the vegetables after it has been well
seasoned, and is copiously sprinkled with melted butter; cover
the utensil, and push it into an oven whose heat is not too
fierce. Set it to cook gently in this way, after the manner of a
stew, and frequently sprinkle with melted butter.</p>

<p>When the meats or the pieces of poultry are cooked, the
utensil is uncovered so that the former may acquire a fine colour;
then they are transferred to a dish which should be kept
covered until taken to the table. Now add to the vegetables
(which must not be burned) a sufficient quantity of brown
veal stock (<a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>), transparent and highly seasoned; set the
whole to boil gently for ten minutes, strain through a serviette,
carefully remove all grease from the poëling stock and send
it to the table in a sauceboat at the same time as the meat
or poultry, which, by the bye, is generally garnished.</p>

<p><a id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Remarks on Poëlings.</i>—It is of paramount importance that
these be not moistened during the process of cooking, for in
that case their savour would be the same as that of braised
white meats.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, an exception may be made in the case of such
feathered game as pheasants, partridges, and quails, to which
is added, when nearly cooked, a small quantity of burnt brandy.</p>

<p>It is also very important that the vegetables should not have
their grease removed before their moistening stock is added to
them. The butter used in the cooking absorbs a large proportion
of the savour of both the vegetables and the meat under
treatment, and, to make good this loss, it is essential that the
moistening stock remain at least ten minutes in contact with
the butter. At the end of this time it may be removed without
in the least impairing the aroma of the stock.</p>

<p><i id="g_casserole">Special Poëlings known as “En Casserole,”</i> <i id="g_cocotte">or “En
Cocotte.”</i>—The preparations of butcher’s meats, of poultry, or
game, known as “<a href="#g_casserole">en casserole</a>” or “<a href="#g_cocotte">en cocotte</a>,” are actual
poëlings cooked in special earthenware utensils and served in
the same. Generally, preparations known as “<a href="#g_casserole">en casserole</a>”
are simply cooked in butter, without the addition of vegetables.</p>

<p>When the cooking is done, the piece under treatment is
withdrawn for a moment, and some excellent brown veal stock
(<a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>) is poured into the utensil. This is left to simmer for
a few minutes; the superfluous butter is then removed; the
piece is returned to the earthenware utensil, and it is kept hot,
without being allowed to boil, until it is dished up.</p>

<p>For preparations termed “<a href="#g_cocotte">en cocotte</a>,” the procedure is the
same, except that the piece is garnished with such vegetables
as mushrooms, the bottoms of artichokes, small onions, carrots,
turnips, &amp;c., which are either turned or regularly pared, and
half cooked in butter before being used.</p>

<p>One should endeavour to use only fresh vegetables, and
these should be added to the piece constituting the dish in such
wise as to complete their cooking with it.</p>

<p>The earthenware utensils used for this purpose improve with
use, provided they be cleaned with clean, fresh water, without
any soda or soap. If new utensils have to be used, these
should be filled with water, which is set to boil, and they should
then undergo at least twelve hours’ soaking. For the prescribed
time this water should be kept gently boiling, and then
the utensil should be well wiped and soaked anew, in fresh
water, before being used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="251—The Sautés"><a id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.251"
 >251—THE SAUTÉS</a></h3>

<p>What characterises the process we call “sauté” is that the
object treated is cooked <i>dry</i>—that is to say, solely by means of
a fatty substance such as butter, oil, or grease.</p>

<p>Sautés are made with cut-up fowl or game, or with butcher’s
meat suitably divided up for the purpose.</p>

<p>All products treated in this way must be frizzled—that is
to say, they must be put into the fat when it is very hot in order
that a hardened coating may form around them which will
keep their juices within. This is more particularly desirable
for red meats such as beef and mutton.</p>

<p>The cooking of <i>fowl sautés</i> must, after the meats have been
frizzled, be completed on the stove or, with lid off, in the oven,
where they should be basted with butter after the manner of a
roast.</p>

<p>The pieces are withdrawn from the utensil with a view to
swilling the latter, after which, if they be put back into the sauce
or accompanying garnish, they should only remain therein a
few moments or just sufficiently long to become properly warm.</p>

<p>The procedure is the same for <i>game sautés</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sautés of butcher’s meats</i> (red meats), such as tournedos,
kernels, cutlets, fillets, and noisettes, are always effected on the
stove; the meats are frizzled and cooked with a small quantity
of clarified butter.</p>

<p>The thinner and smaller they are, the more rapidly should
the frizzling process be effected.</p>

<p>When blood appears on the surface of their raw side, they
should be turned over; when drops of blood begin to bedew
their other side, they are known to be cooked.</p>

<p>The swilling of the utensil obtains in all sautés. After
having withdrawn the treated product from the saucepan, remove
the grease and pour the condimentary liquid (a wine), that
forms part of the accompanying sauce, into the saucepan.</p>

<p>Set to boil, so that the solidified gravy lying on the bottom
may dissolve, and add the sauce; or simply add the swilling
liquid to the prepared sauce or accompanying garnish of the
sauté. The utensil used must always be just large enough to
hold the objects to be treated. If it be too large, the parts left
uncovered by the treated meats burn, and swilling is then impossible,
whence there results a loss of the solidified gravy
which is an important constituent in the sauce.</p>

<p><i>Sautés of white, butcher’s meats</i>, such as veal and lamb, must
also be frizzled in hot fat, but their cooking must be completed
gently on the side of the fire, and in many cases with lid on.</p>

<p><a id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Preparations of a mixed nature, which partly resemble
sautés and partly braisings, are also called sautés. Stews, however,
is their most suitable name.</p>

<p>These dishes are made from beef, veal, lamb, game, &amp;c.,
and they are to be found in Part II. under the headings Estouffade;
Goulash<!-- TN: original reads "Goulah" -->; Sautés: Chasseur, Marengo, Bourgeoise;
Navarin; Civet; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the first stage of their preparation, the meats are cut up
small and fried like those of the sautés; in the second, slow
cooking with sauce or garnish makes them akin to braised
meats.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Roasts, Grills, Fryings">3. Roasts, Grills, Fryings.</h3>

<h4 class="subhead" title="">Roasts.</h4>

<p><span class="smc">Of</span> the two usual methods of roasting, the spit will always
be used in preference to the oven, if only on account of the
conditions under which the operation is effected, and whatever
be the kind of fuel used—wood, coal, or gas.</p>

<p>The reason of this preference is clear if it be remembered
that, in spite of every possible precaution during the progress
of an oven roast, it is impossible to avoid an accumulation of
vapour around the cooking object in a closed oven. And this
steam is more particularly objectionable inasmuch as it is excessive
in the case of delicately flavoured meats, which latter
are almost if not entirely impaired thereby.</p>

<p>The spitted roast, on the contrary, cooks in the open in a
dry atmosphere, and by this means retains its own peculiar
flavour. Hence the unquestionable superiority of spitted roasts
over the oven kind, especially in respect of small feathered
game.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances and places there is no choice of
means, and, <i>nolens volens</i>, the oven has to be used; but, in
this case at least, all possible precautions should be observed
in order to counteract the effects of the steam above mentioned.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="252—Larding Bacon For Roasts"><a id="rcp.252"
 >252—LARDING BACON FOR ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>Poultry and game to be roasted ought generally to be partly
covered with a large thin slice of larding bacon, except those
pieces of game which in special cases are larded.</p>

<p>The object and use of these slices are not only to shield the
fillets of fowl and game from the severe heat of the fires but also
to prevent these from drying while the legs, which the heat
takes much longer to penetrate than the other parts, are cooking.
The slices of bacon should therefore completely cover the
<a id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>breasts of fowl and game, and they should be tied on to the
latter by means of string.</p>

<p>In some cases roasts of butcher’s meat are covered with
layers of veal- or beef-fat, the object of which is similar to
that of the bacon prescribed above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="253—Spitted Roasts"><a id="rcp.253"
 >253—SPITTED ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>The whole theory of roasts on the spit might be condensed
as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>In the case of butcher’s meat, calculate the intensity of the
heat used according to the piece to be roasted, the latter’s size
and quality, and the time it has hung. Experience, however, is
the best guide, for any theory, whatever be its exactness, can
only give the leading principles and general rules, and cannot
pretend to supply the place of the practised eye and the accuracy
which are the result of experience alone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do not say with Brillat Savarin that a roaster
is born and not made; I merely state that one may become a
good roaster with application, observation, care, and a little
aptitude.</p>

<p>The three following rules will be found to cover all the
necessary directions for spitted <span class="nw">roasts:—</span></p>

<p>1. All red meats containing a large quantity of juice should
be properly set, and then, according to their size, made to
undergo the action of a fire capable of radiating a very penetrating
heat with little or no flame.</p>

<p>2. In the case of white meats, whose cooking should be
thorough, the fire ought to be so regulated as to allow the
roast to cook and colour simultaneously.</p>

<p>3. With small game the fuel should be wood, but whatever
fuel be used the fire ought to be made up in suchwise as to
produce more flame than glowing embers.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="254—Oven Roasts"><a id="rcp.254"
 >254—OVEN ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>The degree of heat used for each roast must be regulated
according to the nature and size of the latter after the manner
of spitted roasts.</p>

<p>An oven roast, in the first place, should always be placed
on a meatstand, and this should be of such a height that at no
given moment during the cooking process the meat may come
in contact with the juices and fat which have drained from it
into the utensil beneath. Failing a proper stand, a spit resting
upon the edges of the utensil may be used.</p>

<p>No liquid of any kind, gravy or water, need be put in the
baking-pan. The addition of any liquid is rather prejudicial
<a id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>than otherwise, since by producing vapour which hangs over
the roast it transforms the latter into a stew.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Whether spitted or in the oven, a roast must
always be frequently basted with a fatty substance, but never
with any other liquid.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="255—The Gravy of Roasts"><a id="rcp.255"
 >255—THE GRAVY OF ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>The real and most natural gravy for roasts is made from
the swilling of the baking- or dripping-pan, even if water
be used as the diluent, since the contents of these utensils
represent a portion of the essential principles of the roast
fallen from it in the process of cooking. But to obtain
this result neither the utensils nor the gravy ought to have
burned; the latter should merely have solidified, and for this
reason a roast cooked in a very fierce oven ought to be laid
on a pan only just large enough to hold it, so that the fat may
not burn.</p>

<p>The swilling can in any case only produce a very small quantity
of gravy, consequently, when it happens that a greater
quantity is required, the need is met beforehand by preparing
a stock made from bones and trimmings of a similar nature to
the roast for which the gravy is required. The procedure for
this is as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Place the bones and trimmings in a pan with a little fat and
literally roast them. Then transfer them to a saucepan, moisten
so as to cover with tepid, slightly-salted water, and add thereto
the swillings of the pan wherein they were roasted. Boil, skim,
and set to cook gently for three or four hours, according to the
nature of the products used. This done, almost entirely remove
the grease, strain through muslin, and put aside for the purpose
of swilling the dripping- or baking-pan of the roast.</p>

<p><i>Swilling.</i>—Having removed the roast from the spit or oven,
take off a portion of the grease from the baking- or dripping-pan,
and pour into it the required quantity of prepared
gravy. Reduce the whole by half, strain through muslin, and
almost entirely remove grease.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to remove all the grease from, and to clarify,
the gravy of roasts. Treated thus they are certainly clearer and
more sightly, but a large proportion of their savour is lost, and
it should be borne in mind that the gravy of a roast is not a
consommé.</p>

<p>In the matter of roast feathered game, the accompanying
gravy is supplied by the swilling of the utensil, either with water
or a small quantity of brandy. This is a certain means of
obtaining a gravy whose savour is precisely that of the game;
but occasionally veal gravy is used, as its flavour is neutral,
<a id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and it therefore cannot impair the particular flavour of the
reduced game gravy lying on the bottom of the utensil. The
use of stock prepared from the bones and trimmings of game
similar to that constituting the dish is also common.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="256—The Dressing and Accompaniments of Roasts"><a id="rcp.256"
 >256—THE DRESSING AND ACCOMPANIMENTS <span class="nw">OF ROASTS</span></a></h3>

<p>As a rule, a roast ought not to wait. It ought only to leave
the spit or oven in order to be served. All roasts should be
placed on very hot dishes, slightly besprinkled with fresh
butter, and surrounded by bunches of watercress (this is optional).
The gravy is invariably served separately.</p>

<p>Roasts of butcher’s meat and poultry are dished up as simply
as possible.</p>

<p>Small roasted game may be dished up on fried slices of bread-crumb
masked with <i>gratin</i> stuffing (No. <a href="#rcp.202">202</a>).</p>

<p>When lemons accompany a roast, they should be served
separately. Pieces of lemon that have once served to garnish
a dish must not be used, for they have mostly been tainted by
grease.</p>

<p>The mediæval custom of dishing game with the plumage
has been abandoned.</p>

<p>Roast feathered game à l’anglaise is dished up with or
without potato chips, and the three adjuncts are gravy, bread-crumbs,
and bread-sauce.</p>

<p>In northern countries game roasts are always accompanied
either by slightly sugared stewed apples, or by cherry or apricot
jam.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="257—Grills"><a id="rcp.257"
 >257—GRILLS</a></h3>

<p>Those culinary preparations effected by means of grilling
belong to the order called cooking by concentration. And,
indeed, in almost all cases, the great object of these operations,
I might even say the greatest object, is the concentration, in
the centre, of the juices and essences which represent, most
essentially, the nutritive principles of the products cooked.</p>

<p>A grill, which is, in short, but a roast on an open fire, stands,
in my opinion, as the remote starting-point, the very genesis
of our art.</p>

<p>It was the primæval notion of our forefathers’ infantile
brains; it was progress born of an instinctive desire to eat with
greater pleasure; and it was the first culinary method ever
employed.</p>

<p>A little later, and following naturally, as it were, upon this
first attempt, the spit was born of the grill; gradually, intelligence
supplanted rude instinct; reason began to deduce effects
from supposed causes; and thus cooking was launched forth
<a id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>upon that highroad along which it has not yet ceased steadily to
advance.</p>

<p><i>Fuel for Grills.</i>—That mostly used, and certainly the best
for the purpose, is live coal or small pieces of charcoal. Whatever
fuel be used, however, it is essential that it produce no
smoke, even though the grill fire be ventilated by powerful
blowers which draw the smoke off. More especially is this
necessary, though I admit the contingency is rare, when artificial
ventilation has to be effected owing to the fire’s burning in the
open without the usual help of systematic draughts; for if smoke
occasioned by foreign substances or by the falling of the fat
itself on to the glowing embers were not immediately carried
away, either artificially or by a convenient draught, the grills
would most surely acquire a very disagreeable taste therefrom.</p>

<p><i>The Bed of Charcoal.</i>—The arrangement of the bed of charcoal
under the grill is of some importance, and it must not only
be regulated according to the size and kind of the products to
be grilled, but also in such wise as to allow of the production
of more or less heat under given circumstances.</p>

<p>The bed should therefore be set in equal layers in the
centre, but varying in thickness according as to whether the
fire has to be more or less fierce; it should also be slightly
raised on those sides which are in contact with the air, in
order that the whole burning surface may radiate equal degrees
of heat.</p>

<p>The grill must always be placed over the glowing fuel in
advance, and it should be very hot when the objects to be
grilled are placed upon it, otherwise they would stick to the
bars, and would probably be spoiled when turned.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Grills Classified">Grills Classified.</h3>

<p>Grills may be divided into four classes, of which each
demands particular care. They are: (1) Red-meat grills
(beef and mutton); (2) White-meat grills (veal, lamb, poultry);
(3) Fish; (4) Grills coated with butter and bread-crumbs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="258—Red Meat Grills"><a id="rcp.258"
 >258—RED MEAT GRILLS</a></h3>

<p>I submit as a principle that the golden rule in grills is to
strictly observe the correct degree of heat which is proper to
each treated object, never forgetting that the larger and richer
in nutrition the piece of meat, the quicker and more thorough
must be its initial setting.</p>

<p>I have already explained, under braisings, the part played
by, and the use of, <a href="#g_rissole">rissoling</a> or setting; but it is necessary to
revert to this question and its bearing upon grills.</p>

<p>If large pieces of meat (beef or mutton) are in question, the
<a id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>better their quality and the richer they are in juices, the
more resisting must be the <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> coating they receive. The
pressure of the contained juices upon the <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> coating of
this meat will be proportionately great or small according
to whether the latter be rich or poor, and this pressure will
gradually increase with the waxing heat.</p>

<p>If the grill fire be so regulated as to ensure the progressive
penetration of heat into the cooking object, this is what
<span class="nw">happens:—</span></p>

<p>The heat, striking that surface of the meat which is in
direct communication with the fire, penetrates the tissues, and
spreads stratiformly through the body, driving the latter’s
juices in front of it. When these reach the opposite, <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a>,
or set side of the meat, they are checked, and thereupon, absorbing
the incoming heat, effect the cooking of the inner parts.</p>

<p>Of course, if the piece of meat under treatment is very
thick, the fierceness of the fire should be proportionately abated
the moment the initial process of <a href="#g_rissole">rissoling</a> or setting of the
meat’s surface has been effected, the object being to allow the
heat to penetrate the cooking body more regularly. If the
fierceness of the fire were maintained, the <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> coating on
the meat would probably char, and the resulting thickness of
carbon would so successfully resist the passage of any heat
into the interior that, in the end, while the meat would probably
be found to be completely burnt on the outside, the inside
would be quite raw.</p>

<p>If somewhat thinner pieces are in question, a quick <a href="#g_rissole">rissoling</a>
of their surfaces over a fierce fire, and a few minutes of
subsequent cooking, will be all they need. No alteration in
the intensity of the fire need be sought in this case.</p>

<p><i>Examples.</i>—A rumpsteak or Châteaubriand, in order to be
properly cooked, should first have its outsides <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> on a
very fierce fire with a view to preserving its juices, after which
cooking may proceed over a moderate fire so as to allow of
the gradual penetration of the heat into the centre of the body.</p>

<p>Small pieces such as tournedos, small fillets, noisettes,
chops, may, after the preliminary process of outside <a href="#g_rissole">rissoling</a>,
be cooked over the same degree of heat as effected the latter,
because the thickness of meat to be penetrated is less.</p>

<p><i>The Care of Grills while Cooking.</i>—Before placing the
meats on the grill, baste them slightly with clarified butter,
and repeat this operation frequently during the cooking process,
so as to avoid the possible drying of the <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> surfaces.</p>

<p>Grilled red meat should always be turned by means of
special tongs, and great care should be observed that its surface
<a id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be not torn or pierced, lest the object of the preliminary precautions
be defeated, and the contained juices escape.</p>

<p><i>Time of Cooking.</i>—This, in the case of red meats, is arrived
at by the following test: if, on touching the meat with one’s
finger, the former resist any pressure, it is sufficiently cooked:
if it give, it is clear that in the centre, at least, the
reverse is the case. The most certain sign, however, that
cooking has been completed is the appearance of little beads
of blood upon the <a href="#g_rissole">rissoled</a> surface of the meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="259—White-meat Grills"><a id="rcp.259"
 >259—WHITE-MEAT GRILLS</a></h3>

<p>That superficial <a href="#g_rissole">rissoling</a> which is so necessary in the case
of red meats is not at all so in the case of white, for in the latter
there can be no question of the concentration of juices, since
these are only present in the form of albumen—that is to say,
in the form of juices “in the making,” so to speak, which is
peculiar to veal and lamb.</p>

<p>For this kind of grills keep a moderate fire, so that the
cooking and colouring of the meat may take place simultaneously.</p>

<p>White-meat grills should be fairly often basted by means
of a brush, with clarified butter, while cooking, lest their outsides
dry.</p>

<p>They are known to be cooked when the juice issuing from
them is quite white.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="260—Fish Grills"><a id="rcp.260"
 >260—FISH GRILLS</a></h3>

<p>Use a moderate fire with these, and only grill after having
copiously sprinkled them with clarified butter or oil. Sprinkle
them similarly while cooking.</p>

<p>A grilled fish is cooked when the bones are easily separated
from the meat. Except for the fatty kind, such as mackerel,
red mullet, or herrings, always roll fish to be grilled in flour
before sprinkling them with melted butter. The object of so
doing is to give them a golden external crust, which, besides
making them more sightly, keeps them from drying.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="261—The Grilling of Products Coated with Butter and Bread-crumbs"><a id="rcp.261"
 >261—THE GRILLING OF PRODUCTS COATED WITH BUTTER AND BREAD-CRUMBS</a></h3>

<p>These grills generally consist of only small objects; they
must be effected on a very moderate fire, with the view of
enabling them to cook and acquire colour simultaneously.
They should also be frequently besprinkled with clarified butter,
and turned with care, so as not to break their coating, the object
of which is to withhold their contained juices.</p>

 >262—FRYINGS</a></h3>

<p>Frying is one of the principal cooking processes, for the
number of preparations that are accomplished by its means
is very considerable. Its procedure is governed by stringent
laws and rules which it is best not to break, lest the double
danger of failure and impairment of material be incurred.</p>

<p>The former is easily averted if one is familiar with the
process, and pays proper attention to it, while the latter is
obviated by precautions which have every <i>raison d’être</i>, and the
neglect of which only leads to trouble.</p>

<p>The question of the kind of utensil to employ is not so
immaterial as some would think, for very often accidents result
from the mere disregard of the importance of this matter.</p>

<p>Very often imprudence and bluster on the part of the
operator may be the cause of imperfections, the greatest care
being needed in the handling of utensils containing overheated
fat.</p>

<p>Utensils used in frying should be made of copper, or other
resisting metal; they should be in one piece, oval or round in
shape, and sufficiently large and deep to allow, while only half-filled
with fat, of the objects being properly affected by the
latter. The necessity of this condition is obvious, seeing that
if the utensil contain too much fat the slightest jerking of it
on the stove would spill some of the liquid, and the operator
would probably be badly burnt.</p>

<p>Finally, utensils with vertical sides are preferable to those
with the slanting kind; more especially is this so in large
kitchens where, the work involving much frying, capacious receptacles
are required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="263—Frying Fat—its Preparation"><a id="rcp.263"
 >263—FRYING FAT—ITS PREPARATION</a></h3>

<p>Any animal or vegetable grease is suitable for frying, provided
it be quite pure and possess a resisting force allowing
it to reach a very high temperature without burning. But
for frying on a large scale, the use of cooked and clarified
fats, such as the fat of “pot-au-feu” and roasts, should be
avoided.</p>

<p>A frying medium is only perfect when it is able to meet
the demands of a protracted operation, and consists of fresh or
raw fats, chosen with care and thoroughly purified by cooking.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances may butter be used for frying on
a large scale, seeing that, even when thoroughly purified, it
can only reach a comparatively low degree of heat. It may be
used only for <i>small, occasional fryings</i>.</p>

<p>The fat of kidney of beef generally forms the base of the
grease intended for frying on a large scale. It is preferable
<a id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to all others on account of its cheapness and the great length
of time it can be worked, provided it receives the proper care.</p>

<p>Veal-fat yields a finer frying medium, but its resistance is
small, and it must, moreover, always be strengthened with the
fat of beef.</p>

<p>Mutton-fat should be deliberately discarded, for, if it happen
to be that of an old beast, it smells of tallow, and, if it be that
of a young one, it causes the hot grease to foam and to overflow
down the sides of the utensil, this leading to serious accidents.</p>

<p>Pork-fat is also used for frying, either alone, or combined
with some other kind.</p>

<p>In brief, the fat of kidney of beef is that which is best
suited to fryings on a large scale. Ordinary household frying,
which does not demand a very resisting grease, may well be
effected by means of the above, combined with an equal quantity
of veal-fat, or a mixture composed of the fat of kidney of beef,
veal, and pork in the proportions of one-half, one-quarter, and
one-quarter respectively.</p>

<p>The grease used for frying ought not only to be melted
down, but also thoroughly cooked, so that it may be quite
pure. If insufficiently cooked, it foams on first being used,
and so demands all kinds of extra precautions, which only
cease to be necessary when constant heating at last rectifies it.
Moreover, if it be not quite pure, it easily penetrates immersed
solids and makes them indigestible.</p>

<p>All grease used in frying should first be cut into pieces and
then put into the saucepan with one pint of water per every
ten lbs.</p>

<p>The object of the water is to assist in the melting, and this
it does by filtering into the grease, vaporising, and thereby
causing the latter to swell. So long as the water has not completely
evaporated, the grease only undergoes the action of
liquefaction, <i>i.e.</i>, the dissolution of its molecules; but its
thorough cooking process, ending with its purification, only
begins when all the water is gone.</p>

<p>The grease is cooked when (1) the membranes which enveloped
it alone remain intact and are converted into greaves;
(2) it gives off smoke which has a distinct smell.</p>

<p>At this stage it has reached such a high temperature that
it is best to remove it from the fire for about ten minutes, so
that it may cool; then it must be strained through a sieve, or
a coarse towel, which must be tightly twisted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="264—The Various Degrees of Heat Reached by the Frying Medium, and their Application"><a id="rcp.264"
 >264—THE VARIOUS DEGREES OF HEAT REACHED BY THE FRYING MEDIUM, AND THEIR APPLICATION</a></h3>

<p>The temperature reached by a frying medium depends upon
<a id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the latter’s constituents and its purity. The various degrees
may be classified as moderately hot, hot, very hot.</p>

<p>The expression “boiling hot” is unsuitable, seeing that fat
never boils. Butter (an occasional frying medium) cannot overreach
248° F. without burning, whereas if it be thoroughly
purified it can attain from 269° to 275° F.—a temperature which
is clearly below what would be needed for work on a large
scale.</p>

<p>Animal greases used in ordinary frying reach from 275° to
284° F. when moderately hot, 320° F. when hot, and 356° F.
when very hot; in the last case they smoke slightly.</p>

<p>Pork-fat (lard), when used alone, reaches 392° F. without
burning. Very pure goose dripping withstands 428° F.; and,
finally, vegetable fats may reach, without burning, 482° F. in
the case of cocoa-nut butter, 518° F. with ordinary oils, and
554° in the case of olive oil.</p>

<p>The temperature of ordinary frying fat may be tested thus:
it is moderately hot when, after throwing a sprig of parsley
or a crust of bread into it, it begins to bubble immediately; it
is hot if it crackles when a slightly moist object is thrust into
it; it is very hot when it gives off a thin white smoke perceptible
to the smell.</p>

<p>The first temperature, “moderately hot,” is used (1) for all
products containing vegetable water the complete evaporation
of which is necessary; (2) for fish whose volume exacts a cooking
process by means of penetration, previous to that with concentration.</p>

<p>In the first degree of heat with which it is used the frying
fat therefore only effects a kind of preparatory operation.</p>

<p>The second temperature, “hot,” is used for all products
which have previously undergone an initial cooking process
in the first temperature, either for evaporation or penetration,
and its object is either to finish them or to cover them with a
crimped coating.</p>

<p>It is also applicable to those products upon which the frying
fat must act immediately by concentration—that is to say, by
forming a set coating around them which prevents the escape
of the contained substances.</p>

<p>Objects treated with this temperature are: all those <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>panés à
l’anglaise</i></a> or covered with batter, such as various <i>croquettes</i>,
<i>cromesquis</i>, cutlets, and collops à la Villeroy, fritters of all
kinds, fried creams, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In this case the frying medium acts by setting, which in
certain cases is exceedingly necessary.</p>

<p>1. If the objects in question are <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>panés à l’anglaise</i></a>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<a id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dipped in beaten eggs and rolled in bread-crumbs, the sudden
contact of the hot grease converts this coating of egg and bread-crumbs into
a resisting crust, which prevents the escape of the
substances and the liquefied sauce contained within.</p>

<p>If these objects were plunged in a fat that was not sufficiently
hot, the coating of egg and bread-crumbs would not
only imbibe the frying medium, but it would run the risk of
breaking, thereby allowing the escape of the very substances it
was intended to withhold.</p>

<p>2. The same holds with objects treated with batter. Hence
the absolute necessity of ensuring that setting which means
that the covering of batter solidifies immediately. As the substances
constituting these various dishes are cooked in advance,
it follows that their second heating and the colouring of the
coating (egg and bread-crumbs or batter) take place at the same
time and in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The third temperature, “very hot,” is used (1) for all objects
that need a sharp and firm setting; (2) for all small objects the
setting of which is of supreme importance, and whose cooking
is effected in a few minutes, as in the case of whitebait.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="265—Frying Medium For Fish"><a id="rcp.265"
 >265—FRYING MEDIUM FOR FISH</a></h3>

<p>Every frying medium, used for work on a large scale, which
has acquired a too decided colouring through repeated use,
may serve in the preparation of fish even until its whole strength
is exhausted.</p>

<p>Oil is best suited to the frying of fish, especially the very
small kind, owing to the tremendous heat it can withstand without
burning, for this heat guarantees that setting which is so
indispensable.</p>

<p>Except in this case, however, the temperature of the frying
medium should be regulated strictly in accordance with the
size of the fish to be fried, in order that its cooking and colouring
may be effected simultaneously.</p>

<p>Except <i>Nonats</i> and whitebait, which are simply rolled in
flour, fish to be fried are previously steeped in slightly salted
milk and then rolled in flour. From this combination of milk
and flour there results a crisp coating which withholds those
particular principles that the fish exude while cooking.</p>

<p>When finished, fried fish are drained, dried, slightly salted,
and dished on a serviette or on paper, with a garnish of fried
parsley-sprays and sections of channelled lemon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="266—The Quantity of the Frying Medium"><a id="rcp.266"
 >266—THE QUANTITY OF THE FRYING MEDIUM</a></h3>

<p>This should always be in proportion to the quantity or size
<a id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the objects to be fried, bearing in mind that these must
always be entirely submerged.</p>

<p>Without necessarily exaggerating, the quantity should invariably
be rather in excess of the requirements, and for this
reason, viz., the greater the amount of fat, the higher will
be the temperature reached, and the less need one fear a sudden
cooling of the fat when the objects to be treated are immersed.
This sudden cooling is often the cause of great trouble, unless
one be working over a fire of such fierceness that the fat can
return in a few seconds to the temperature it was at before the
objects were immersed.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="267—The Care of the Frying Medium"><a id="rcp.267"
 >267—THE CARE OF THE FRYING MEDIUM</a></h3>

<p>Every time a frying fat is used it should, after having been
melted, be strained through a towel, for the majority of objects
which it has served to cook must have left some particles behind
them which might prove prejudicial to the objects that are to
follow.</p>

<p>Objects that are “<i>panés</i>” always leave some raspings, for
instance, which in time assume the form of black powder, while
those that have been treated with flour likewise drop some of
their coating, which, in accumulating, produces a muddy precipitate
on the bottom of the utensil.</p>

<p>Not only do these foreign substances disturb the clearness
of the fat and render it liable to burn, but they are exceedingly
detrimental to the objects that are treated later.</p>

<p>Therefore, always strain the fat whenever it is used—in the
first place because the proper treatment of the objects demands
it, and, secondly, because its very existence as a serviceable
medium depends upon this measure.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="268—Gratins" id="g_gratin"><a id="rcp.268"
 >268—GRATINS</a></h3>

<p>This culinary operation plays a sufficiently important part
in the work to warrant my detailing at least its leading points.</p>

<p>The various kinds of the order “Gratins” are (1) the Complete
Gratin; (2) the Rapid Gratin; (3) the Light Gratin;
(4) Glazing, which is a form of Rapid Gratin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="269—Complete Gratin"><a id="rcp.269"
 >269—COMPLETE GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>This is the first example of the series; it is that whose preparation
is longest and most tiresome; for its principal constituent,
whatever this is, must be completely cooked. Its
cooking must moreover be coincident with the reduction of the
sauce, which is the base of the gratin, and with the formation
of the gratin proper, <i>i.e.</i>, the crimped crust which forms on
the surface and is the result of the combination of the sauce
<a id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with the raspings and the butter, under the direct influence of
the heat.</p>

<p>In the preparation of complete gratin, two things must be
taken into <span class="nw">account:—</span>(1) The nature and size of the object to
be treated, and (2) the degree of heat which must be used in
order that the cooking of the object, the reduction of the sauce,
and the formation of the gratin may be effected simultaneously.</p>

<p>The base of complete gratin is almost invariably ordinary
or Lenten duxelle sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.223">223</a>), in accordance with the requirements.</p>

<p>The object to be treated with the gratin is laid on a buttered
dish, surrounded with slices of raw mushrooms and chopped
shallots, and covered with duxelle sauce. The surface is then
sprinkled with raspings, and copiously moistened with melted
butter. Should the piece be large, the amount of sauce used
will be proportionately greater, and the reverse, of course,
applies to medium or smaller sizes.</p>

<p>Take note of the following remarks in the making of complete
<span class="nw">gratins:—</span></p>

<p>1. If too much sauce were used in proportion to the size
of the object, the latter would cook and the gratin form before
the sauce could reach the correct degree of consistence by means
of reduction. Hence it would be necessary to reduce the sauce
still further on the stove, and thereby give rise to steam which
would soften the coating of the gratin.</p>

<p>2. If the sauce used were insufficient, it would be reduced
before the cooking of the object had been effected, and, more
sauce having to be added, the resulting gratin would be uneven.</p>

<p>3. The larger the piece, and consequently the longer it
takes to cook, the more moderate should be the heat used.
Conversely, the smaller it is, the fiercer should the fire be.</p>

<p>When withdrawing the gratin from the oven squeeze a
few drops of lemon-juice over it, and besprinkle it with
chopped parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="270—Rapid Gratin"><a id="rcp.270"
 >270—RAPID GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as above, with duxelle sauce, but the products
treated with it, viz., meats, fish, or vegetables, are always
cooked and warmed in advance. All that is required, therefore,
is to effect the formation of the gratin as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>To do this, cover the object under treatment with the necessary
quantity of salt, besprinkle with raspings and butter, and
set the gratin to form in a fierce oven.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="271—Light Gratin"><a id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.271"
 >271—LIGHT GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>This is proper to farinaceous products, such as macaroni,
lazagnes, noodles, gnocchi, &amp;c., and consists of a combination
of grated cheese, raspings, and butter. In this case, again,
the only end in view is the formation of the <i>gratin</i> coating, which
must be evenly coloured, and is the result of the cheese melting.
A moderate heat is all that is wanted for this kind of <i>gratin</i>.</p>

<p>Also considered as light <i>gratins</i> are those which serve as
the complement of stuffed vegetables such as tomatoes, mushrooms,
egg-plant, and cucumber. With these the <i>gratin</i> is
composed of raspings sprinkled with butter or oil, and it is
placed in a more or less fierce heat according to whether the
vegetables have already been cooked or partially cooked, or are
quite raw.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="272—Glazings"><a id="rcp.272"
 >272—GLAZINGS</a></h3>

<p>These are of two kinds—they either consist of a heavily
buttered sauce, or they form from a sprinkling of cheese upon
the sauce with which the object to be glazed is covered.</p>

<p>In the first case, after having poured sauce over the object
to be treated, place the dish on another dish containing a little
water. This is to prevent the sauce decomposing and boiling.
The greater the quantity of butter used, the more intense will
be the heat required, in order that a slight golden film may form
almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>In the second case, the sauce used is always a Mornay (No. <a href="#rcp.91">91</a>). Cover the object under treatment with the sauce, besprinkle
with grated cheese and melted butter, and place in
fairly intense heat, so that a slight golden crust may form
almost immediately, this crust being the result of the combined
cheese and butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="273—Blanchings" id="g_blanch"><a id="rcp.273"
 >273—BLANCHINGS</a></h3>

<p>The essentially unsuitable term blanchings is applied in the
culinary technology of France to three classes of operations
which entirely differ one from the other in the end they have
in view.</p>

<p>1. The blanching of meats.</p>

<p>2. The blanching, or, better, the parboiling of certain
vegetables.</p>

<p>3. The blanching of certain other vegetables, which in reality
amounts to a process of cooking.</p>

<p><i>The blanching of meats</i> obtains mostly in the case of calf’s
head and foot and the sweet-bread of veal, sheep’s and lambs’
<a id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>trotters, and lamb’s sweet-bread. These meats are first set to
soak in cold, running water until they have quite got rid of
the blood with which they are naturally saturated. They are
then placed on the fire in a saucepan containing enough cold
water to abundantly cover them, and the water is gradually
brought to the boil.</p>

<p>For calf’s head or feet, boiling may last for fifteen or twenty
minutes; veal sweet-bread must not boil for more than ten or
twelve minutes; while lamb sweet-bread is withdrawn the
moment the boil is reached.</p>

<p>As soon as blanched, the meats are cooled in plenty of fresh
water before undergoing their final treatment.</p>

<p><i>The blanching of cocks’ combs</i> is exceptional in this,
namely, that after the combs have been cleansed of blood—that
is to say, soaked in cold water, they are placed on the fire in
cold water, the temperature of which must be carefully kept
below 113° F. When this degree is approached, take the
saucepan off the fire and rub each comb with a cloth, dusted
with table-salt, in order to remove the skins; then cool the
combs with fresh water before cooking them.</p>

<p>Many people use the blanching process with meats intended
for “blanquette” or “fricassée.” I regard this procedure as
quite erroneous, as also the preliminary soaking in cold water.</p>

<p>If the meats or pieces of poultry intended for the above-mentioned
preparations be of a good quality (and no others
should be used), they need only be set to cook in cold water,
or cold stock, and gradually brought to the boil, being stirred
repeatedly the while. The scum formed should be carefully
removed, and, in this way, perfectly white meats and stock,
with all their savour, are obtained.</p>

<p>As to meats or pieces of poultry of an inferior quality, no
soaking and no blanching can make good their defects. Whichever
way they are treated they remain dry, gray, and savourless.
It is therefore simpler and better to use only the finest quality
goods.</p>

<p>An excellent proof of the futility of soaking and blanching
meats intended for “fricassées” and “blanquettes” lies in
the fact that these very meats, if of good quality, are always
perfectly white when they are braised, <a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a>, or roasted, notwithstanding
the fact that these three operations are less calculated
to preserve their whiteness than the kind of treatment
they are subjected to in the case of “blanquettes” and
“fricassées.”</p>

<p>Mere routine alone can account for this practice of soaking
<a id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and blanching meats—a practice that is absolutely condemned
by common sense.</p>

<p>The term “blanching” is wrongly applied to the cooking
of green vegetables, such as French beans, green peas, Brussels
sprouts, spinach, &amp;c. The cooking of these, which is effected
by means of boiling salted water, ought really to be termed
“<a href="#g_anglaise_2">à l’anglaise</a>.” All the details of the procedure, however, will
be given when I deal with the vegetables to which the latter
apply.</p>

<p>Lastly, under the name of “blanching,” there exists another
operation which consists in partly cooking certain vegetables
in plenty of water, in order to rid them of any bitter or pungent
flavour they may possess. The time allowed for this blanching
varies according to the age of the vegetables, but when the
latter are young and in season, it amounts to little more than
a mere scalding.</p>

<p>Blanching is chiefly resorted to for lettuce, chicory, endives,
celery, artichokes, cabbages, and the green vegetables; carrots,
turnips, and small onions when they are out of season. In
respect of vegetable-marrows, cucumbers, and chow-chow,
blanching is often left to the definite cooking process, which
should then come under the head of the “<a href="#g_anglaise_1">à l’anglaise</a>”
cooking.</p>

<p>After the process of blanching, the vegetables I have just
enumerated are always cooled—that is to say, steeped in cold
water until they are barely lukewarm. They are then left to
drain on a sieve, previous to undergoing the final cooking
process to which they are best suited, this generally being
braising.</p>

<h4 title=""><i>Various Preparations.</i></h4>


<h3 class="recipe" title="274—The Treatment of Dry Vegetables"><a id="rcp.274"
 >274—THE TREATMENT OF DRY VEGETABLES</a></h3>

<p>It is wrong to soak dry vegetables. If they are of good
quality, and the produce of the year, they need only be put
into a saucepan with enough cold water to completely cover
them, and with one oz. of salt per five quarts of water.</p>

<p>Set to boil gently, skim, add the aromatic garnish, quartered
carrots, onions, with or without garlic cloves, and a faggot,
and set to cook gently with lid on.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—If the vegetables used are old or inferior in
quality, they might be put to soak in soft water; but this only
long enough to swell them slightly, <i>i.e.</i>, about one and one-half
hours.</p>

<p>A prolonged soaking of dry vegetables may give rise to
incipient germination, and this, by impairing the principles of
the vegetables, depreciates the value of the food, and may
even cause some harm to the consumer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="275—Braised Vegetables"><a id="rcp.275"
 >275—BRAISED VEGETABLES</a></h3>

<p>Vegetables to be braised must be first <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a>, cooled,
pared, and strung.</p>

<p>Garnish the bottom of a saucepan with <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> pork-rind,
sliced carrots and onions, and a faggot, and cover the sides
of the utensil with thin slices of bacon. Lay the vegetables
upon the prepared litter, and leave them to sweat in the oven
for about ten minutes with lid on. The object of this oven-sweating
is to expel the water. Now moisten enough to cover
with white stock, and set to cook gently.</p>

<p>This done, drain, remove string, and cut to the shape required.
Lay them in a sautépan, and, if they are to be served
soon, cover them with their reduced stock from which the grease
has been removed.</p>

<p>If they are prepared in advance, simply put them aside in
suitable basins, cover them with their cooking-liquor, which
should be strained over them, boiling, and without its grease
removed, and cover with buttered paper.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Adjuncts to Braised Vegetables">Adjuncts to Braised Vegetables</h3>

<p>According to the case, the adjunct is either the braising-liquor,
reduced and with all grease removed, or the same completed
by means of an addition of meat-glaze.</p>

<p><a id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Occasionally, it may be the braising-liquor slightly thickened
with half-glaze and finished with butter and the juice of a
lemon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="276—Leason of Green Vegetables With Butter"><a id="rcp.276"
 >276—LEASON OF GREEN VEGETABLES WITH BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>First thoroughly drain the vegetables and toss them over
the fire for a few minutes, in order to completely rid them of
their moisture. Season according to the kind of vegetable; add
the butter away from the fire, and slightly toss, rolling the
saucepan meanwhile on the stove with the view of effecting the
leason by means of the mixing of the butter with the treated
vegetables.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="277—Leason of Vegetables With Cream"><a id="rcp.277"
 >277—LEASON OF VEGETABLES WITH CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Vegetables to be treated in this way must be kept somewhat
firm. After having thoroughly drained them, put them
into a saucepan with enough boiling fresh cream to well moisten
without covering them.</p>

<p>Finish their cooking process in the cream, stirring occasionally
the while.</p>

<p>When the cream is almost entirely reduced, finish, away from
the fire, with a little butter.</p>

<p>The leason may be slightly stiffened, if necessary, by means
of a few tablespoonfuls of cream sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="278—Vegetable Creams and Purées"><a id="rcp.278"
 >278—VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PURÉES<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Purées of dry and farinaceous vegetables may be obtained
by rubbing the latter through a sieve.</p>

<p>Put the purée into a sautépan, and dry it over a brisk fire,
adding one and one-half oz. of butter per pint of purée; then
add milk or cream in small quantities at a time, until the purée
has reached the required degree of consistence.</p>

<p>For purées of aqueous vegetables, such as French beans,
cauliflowers, celery, &amp;c., a quarter of their volume of mashed
potatoes should be added to them in order to effect their leason.</p>

<p>In the case of vegetable creams, substitute for the thickening
of mashed potatoes an equivalent quantity of succulent and
stiff Béchamel sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="279—Garnishes"><a id="rcp.279"
 >279—GARNISHES</a></h3>

<p>In cookery, although garnishes only play a minor part,
they are, nevertheless, very important, for, besides being the
principal accompaniments to dishes, they are very often the
<a id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>adornment thereof, while it frequently happens that their harmonious
arrangement considerably helps to throw the beauty
of a fine joint or bird into relief.</p>

<p>A garnish may consist of one or more products. Be this
as it may, its name, as a rule, distinctly denotes, in a word,
what it is and how it is made.</p>

<p>In any case, it should always bear some relation to the piece
it accompanies, either in the constituents of its preparation or
with regard to the size of the piece constituting the dish.</p>

<p>I merely add that, since the constituents of garnishes are
strictly denoted by the name the latter bear, any addition of
products foreign to their nature would be a grave mistake. Likewise,
the omission of any constituent is to be avoided, as the
garnish would thereby be out of keeping with its specified
character.</p>

<p>Only in very exceptional circumstances should any change
of this kind be allowed to take place.</p>

<p>The constituents of garnishes are supplied by vegetables,
farinaceous products, quenelles of all kinds, cocks’ combs and
kidneys, truffles and mushrooms, plain or stuffed olives, molluscs
(mussels or oysters), shell-fish (crayfish, shrimps, lobster, &amp;c.), butcher’s supplies, such as lamb’s sweet-bread, calf’s
brains, and calf’s spine-marrow.</p>

<p>As a rule, garnishes are independent of the dish itself—that
is to say, they are prepared entirely apart. At other times
they are mixed with it, playing the double part of garnish and
condimentary principle, as in the case of Matelotes, Compotes,
Civets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Vegetables for garnishing are fashioned and treated in accordance
with the use and shape implied by the name of the
dish, which should always be the operator’s guide in this
respect.</p>

<p>The farinaceous ones, the molluscs and shell-fish, undergo
the customary preparation.</p>

<p>I have already described (Chapter X.) the preparation of
quenelles and forcemeats for garnishing. Other recipes which
have the same purpose will be treated in their respective order.</p>

 >RECIPES AND MODES OF PROCEDURE</h2>


<p><span class="smc">In</span> <a href="#png.019">Part I.</a> of this work I treated of the general principles
on which the science of cookery is founded, and the leading
operations constituting the basis of the work.</p>

<p>In Part II. I shall proceed from the general to the particular—in
other words, I shall set forth the recipes of every dish I
touch upon, its method of preparation, and its constituent
parts.</p>

<p>With the view of making reference as easy as possible, without
departing from a certain logical order, I have adopted the
method of classifying these recipes in accordance with the
position the dishes they represent hold in the ordinary menu,
and thus, starting with the hors-d’œuvres, I go straight on
to the dessert. I was compelled, however, to alter my plan
in the case of eggs, which never appear on the menu of a dinner
save in Lent.</p>

<p>These I have therefore placed immediately after the hors-d’œuvres,
which, like eggs, should only be served at luncheons,
for reasons I shall explain later.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I have placed the Savouries before the
Entremets, instead of after the Ices, as is customary in
England. My reason for this apparent anomaly is that I consider
it a positive gastronomical heresy to eat fish, meats, fowl-remains, &amp;c., after delicate Entremets and Ices, the subtle
flavour of the latter, which form such an agreeable item in a
dinner, being quite destroyed by the violent seasoning of the
former.</p>

<p>Moreover, the very pretext brought forward in support of
this practice, so erroneous from the gastronomical standpoint,
namely, “that after a good dinner it is necessary to serve
something strange and highly seasoned, in order to whet the
diner’s thirst,” is its own condemnation.</p>

<p>For, if appetite is satiated and thirst is quenched, it follows
<a id="png.154" href="#png.154"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that the consumer has taken all that is necessary. Therefore,
anything more that he may be stimulated to take will only
amount to excess, and excess in gastronomy, as in everything
else, is a fault that can find no excuse.</p>

<p>At all events, I could agree to no more than the placing of
the Savouries before mild Entremets, and, even so, the former
would have to consist of light, dry preparations, very moderately
seasoned, such as <a href="#g_paillettes">Paillettes</a> with Parmesan, various
kinds of dry biscuits, and small tartlets garnished with cheese
<i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i>.</p>

<p>In short, if I expressed my plain opinion on the matter, I
should advise the total suppression of Savouries in a dinner.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XI<br
 ><small class="allsc">HORS-D’ŒUVRES</small></h2>


<h3 class="subhead" title="General Remarks">General Remarks</h3>

<p>The preparations described hereafter all belong to the order
of cold hors-d’œuvres. I did not deem it necessary to touch
upon the hot kind, for, apart from the fact that these are very
seldom served in England, at least under the head of hors-d’œuvres,
they are mostly to be found either among the hot
Entrées or the Savouries proper.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, hors-d’œuvres should only form part
of a meal that does not comprise soup, while the rule of serving
them at luncheons only ought to be looked upon as absolute.</p>

<p>It is true that restaurants à la carte deliberately deviate from
this rule, but it should be remembered, in their case, that, in
addition to the fact that “hors-d’œuvres de luxe,” such as
caviare, oysters, plovers’ and lapwings’ eggs, &amp;c., are mostly
in question, they also find the use of hors-d’œuvres expedient
if only as a means of whiling away the customers’ time during
the preparation of the various dishes that may have been
ordered.</p>

<p>Moreover, the hors-d’œuvres enumerated are not subject
to the same objection as those composed of fish, salads, and
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> vegetables. The use of cold hors-d’œuvres in these
special cases is thus, to a certain extent, justified, but it is
nevertheless to be regretted that an exception of this kind should
degenerate into a habit, and that it should be made to prevail
under circumstances which, in themselves, are insufficient
warrant for the abuse.</p>

<p>In Russia it is customary to have a sideboard in a room
adjoining the dining-room, dressed with all kinds of special
pastries, smoked fish, and other products, and these the diners
partake of, standing, together with strong liqueurs, before taking
their seats at the table. The general name given to the items
on the sideboard is “Zakouski.” Caterers and hotel-keepers in
different parts of the world, more zealous than judicious, introduced
the custom of the zakouski without allowing for the
<a id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>differences of race, which are due, to some extent, to the influence
of climate; and at first, probably owing to everybody’s
enthusiasm for things Russian, the innovation enjoyed a
certain vogue, in spite of the fact that, in many cases, the dishes
served resembled the Zakouski in name alone, and consisted of
cold and very ordinary hors-d’œuvres, served at the dining-table
itself.</p>

<p>At length the absurdity of investing such common things
as hors-d’œuvres with an exotic title began to be perceived,
and nowadays the occasions are rare when the Russian term
is to be found on a menu; nevertheless, the custom unfortunately
survives.</p>

<p>For my own part, I regard cold hors-d’œuvres as quite
unnecessary in a dinner; I even consider them counter to the
dictates of common sense, and they are certainly prejudicial to
the flavour of the soup that follows.</p>

<p>At the most, caviare might be tolerated, the nutty taste of
which, when it is quite fresh, can but favourably impress the
consumer’s palate, as also certain fine oysters, provided they
be served with very dry Rhine wine or white Bordeaux. But
I repeat that hors-d’œuvres consisting of any kind of fish,
salad, <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> vegetables, &amp;c., should be strictly proscribed
from the items of a dinner.</p>

<p>The custom of serving cold hors-d’œuvres at lunch is, on
the contrary, not only traditional, but indispensable, and their
varied combinations, thrown into relief by tasteful and proper
arrangement, besides lending a cheerful aspect to the table, beguile
the consumer’s attention and fancy from the very moment
of his entering the dining-room. It has been said, with reason,
that soups should foretell the dominant note of the whole
dinner, and cold hors-d’œuvres should in the same way reveal
that of a luncheon.</p>

<p>Possibly it was with a sense of the importance of hors-d’œuvres,
from this standpoint, that their preparation was
transferred from the <i>office</i> (the exclusive concern whereof used,
formerly, to be the hors-d’œuvres) to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The results of this change manifested themselves immediately
in prodigious variations and transformations of the
hors-d’œuvres, both in respect of their preparation and dishing-up,
so much so, indeed, that perhaps in no other department
of culinary art has there been such progress of recent years.</p>

<p>Their variety is infinite, and it would be impossible to
compute, even approximately, the number of combinations an
ingenious artist could effect in their preparation, seeing that
<a id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the latter embraces almost every possible use of every conceivable
esculent product.</p>

<p>Well may it be said that a good hors-d’œuvrier is a man
to be prized in any kitchen, for, although his duties do not
by any means rank first in importance, they nevertheless
demand in him who performs them the possession of such
qualities as are rarely found united in one person, viz., reliable
and experienced taste, originality, keen artistic sense, and professional
knowledge.</p>

<p>The hors-d’œuvrier should be able to produce something
sightly and good out of very little, and the beauty and attractiveness
of a hors-d’œuvre should depend to a much greater degree
upon his work and the judicious treatment of his material than
upon the nature of the latter.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Preparation for Hors-d’Œuvres">Preparation for Hors-d’Œuvres</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="280—Butters and Creams"><a id="rcp.280"
 >280—BUTTERS AND CREAMS</a></h3>

<p>The seasoning of butters for hors-d’œuvres is effected when
dishing them up. When prepared in advance, they ought to
be placed in a bowl and put aside somewhere in the cool,
covered with a piece of clean paper.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="281—Anchovy Butter"><a id="rcp.281"
 >281—ANCHOVY BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Wash twelve or fifteen anchovies in cold water, and dry them
thoroughly. Remove the fillets from the bones, pound them
smoothly with four oz. of butter, rub the whole through a fine
sieve, smooth it with a spoon, and put it aside.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="282—Caviare Butter"><a id="rcp.282"
 >282—CAVIARE BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Pound three oz. of pressed caviare with four oz. of butter,
and rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="283—Shrimp Butter"><a id="rcp.283"
 >283—SHRIMP BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of shrimps with four oz. of butter; rub
through a fine sieve first, then through muslin, after having
softened the preparation.</p>

<p>This may also be made from the shelled tails of shrimps,
which process, though it is easier, does not yield a butter of
such delicate taste as the former.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="284—Curry Butter"><a id="rcp.284"
 >284—CURRY BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Soften four oz. of butter in a bowl, and add thereto sufficient
curry-powder to ensure a decided taste. The exact
quantity of curry cannot be prescribed, since the quality of the
latter entirely governs its apportionment.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="285—Crayfish Butter"><a id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.285"
 >285—CRAYFISH BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Cook the crayfish with <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, as for Bisque. Finely
pound the shells after having removed the tails, and add thereto
four oz. of butter per two oz.; rub through a fine sieve first,
then through muslin.</p>

<p>N.B.—The whole crayfish may be pounded, but the tails
are usually laid aside with a view to supplying the garnish
of the toasts for which the butter is intended.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="286—Red-herring Butter"><a id="rcp.286"
 >286—RED-HERRING BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Take the fillets of three red-herrings; remove the skins, and
pound finely with three oz. of butter. Rub through a fine
sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="287—Lobster Butter"><a id="rcp.287"
 >287—LOBSTER BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of lobster trimmings and spawn, and a little
of the coral with four oz. of butter. Rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="288—Milt Butter"><a id="rcp.288"
 >288—MILT BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Poach four oz. of milt in a covered and buttered sauté-pan,
with the juice of half a lemon; pound in the mortar, and add
to the preparation its weight of butter and a teaspoonful of
mustard. Rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="289—Montpellier Butter (Green Butter)"><a id="rcp.289"
 >289—MONTPELLIER<!-- TN: original reads "MONTPELIER" --> BUTTER (GREEN BUTTER)</a></h3>

<p>See Compound Butter for Sauces (No. <a href="#rcp.153">153</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="290—Horse-radish Butter"><a id="rcp.290"
 >290—HORSE-RADISH BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Grate two oz. of horse-radish and pound with four oz. of
butter. Rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="291—Smoked Salmon Butter"><a id="rcp.291"
 >291—SMOKED SALMON BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound four oz. of smoked salmon with as much
butter, and rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="292—Paprika Butter"><a id="rcp.292"
 >292—PAPRIKA BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Soften four oz. of butter in a bowl, and mix therewith a
small teaspoonful of paprika infused in a few drops of white
wine or consommé, with a view to strengthening the colour of
the paprika.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="293—Pimento Butter"><a id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.293"
 >293—PIMENTO BUTTER</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of preserved or freshly-cooked capsicum;
add as much butter thereto, and rub through a fine sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="294—Caviare Cream"><a id="rcp.294"
 >294—CAVIARE CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of preserved caviare and add thereto, little
by little, two tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz. of
softened butter. Rub through a fine sieve, and finish the preparation
by an addition of three tablespoonfuls of whisked
cream.</p>

<p>N.B.—This cream and those that follow often take the
place of the butters in the preparation of hors-d’œuvres. The
addition of previously well-softened butter to these creams is
necessary in order to make them sufficiently consistent when
they cool.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="295—Lobster Cream"><a id="rcp.295"
 >295—LOBSTER CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of lobster trimmings, spawn, and coral, and
add thereto three tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz.
of softened butter.</p>

<p>Rub through a sieve, and complete the preparation with
whisked cream, as above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="296—Game Cream"><a id="rcp.296"
 >296—GAME CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Pound four oz. of cold, cooked game-meat with three tablespoonfuls
of fresh cream and two oz. of softened butter. Rub
through a sieve, and finish the preparation with three tablespoonfuls
of whisked cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="297—Smoked Salmon Cream"><a id="rcp.297"
 >297—SMOKED SALMON CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound four oz. of smoked salmon, and add thereto,
little by little, three tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz.
of softened butter. Rub the whole through a sieve, and finish
with an addition of three tablespoonfuls of whisked cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="298—Tunny Cream"><a id="rcp.298"
 >298—TUNNY CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound four oz. of tunny in oil, and finish the cream
similarly to that of the Smoked Salmon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="299—Chicken Cream"><a id="rcp.299"
 >299—CHICKEN CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound four oz. of cold fowl (white parts only) and
add thereto two tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz. of
softened butter. Rub through a sieve, and finish with three
tablespoonfuls of whisked cream.</p>

<p>N.B.—This cream ought to be made and seasoned with
salt immediately before being served.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="299a—Mustard Sauce with Cream"><a id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]<br

salt, pepper, and a few drops of lemon-juice. Mix the whole
and add, little by little, the necessary quantity of very fresh
cream.</p>

 >300—ANCHOVY ALLUMETTES</a></h3>

<p>Roll some puff-paste trimmings into rectangular strips two
and one-half inches wide and one-eighth inch thick. Spread
thereon a thin coating of fish stuffing, finished with anchovy
butter; lay the anchovy fillets, prepared beforehand, lengthwise
on this stuffing, and cut into pieces about one inch wide. Place
the pieces on a baking-tray, and set to bake in the oven for
twelve minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="301—Anchovy Fillets"><a id="rcp.301"
 >301—ANCHOVY FILLETS</a></h3>

<p>Cut each halved anchovy, which should have been previously
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> in oil, into two or three little fillets. Place them
across each other in a hors-d’œuvre dish, after the manner of
a lattice; garnish with chopped parsley and the chopped white
and yolk of a hard-boiled egg, alternating the colours. Put
a few capers on the fillets, and besprinkle moderately with oil.
Anchovy fillets may also be served on a salad of <i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i>
lettuce, for the sake of variety.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="302—Fresh Marinaded Anchovies"><a id="rcp.302"
 >302—FRESH MARINADED ANCHOVIES</a></h3>

<p>Take a few live anchovies, cleanse them, and put them in
salt for two hours. This done, plunge them in smoking oil,
where they may remain only just long enough to stiffen.
Drain, place them in a moderately acid <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>, and serve
on a hors-d’œuvre dish with a little <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="303—Rolled Anchovies"><a id="rcp.303"
 >303—ROLLED ANCHOVIES</a></h3>

<p>Turn some fine olives and stuff them with anchovy butter;
when quite cold, encircle them with a ring of anchovy fillet,
kept whole.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="304—Anchovy Medallions"><a id="rcp.304"
 >304—ANCHOVY MEDALLIONS</a></h3>

<p>Cut into discs, about the size of half-a-crown, potatoes boiled

 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>anchovy fillets <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> in oil, and garnish their centres either
with caviare, chopped hard-boiled egg, or milt purée, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="305—Anchovy Paupiettes"><a id="rcp.305"
 >305—ANCHOVY PAUPIETTES</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some thick slices of <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>
cucumber, about the size of half-crowns, and hollow their
centres slightly. Place rings composed of the fillets of
anchovies in oil upon these slices, and fill up their centres with
tunny cream or the cream of any fish or shell-fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="306—Anchovy with Pimentos"><a id="rcp.306"
 >306—ANCHOVY WITH PIMENTOS</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some anchovy fillets in oil, and place them across

those of the anchovies. Garnish in the same way as for anchovy
fillets, <i>i.e.</i>, with the chopped white and yolk of a hard-boiled
egg, and chopped parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="307—Norwegian Anchovies or Kilkis"><a id="rcp.307"
 >307—NORWEGIAN ANCHOVIES OR KILKIS</a></h3>

<p>These are found ready-prepared on the market. Place them
on a hors-d’œuvre dish with some of their liquor, and without
any garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="308—Smoked Eel"><a id="rcp.308"
 >308—SMOKED EEL</a></h3>

<p>Serve it plain, cut into fillets.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="309—Eel with White Wine and Paprika"><a id="rcp.309"
 >309—EEL WITH WHITE WINE AND PAPRIKA</a></h3>

<p>Divide the eel into lengths of three and one-half inches;
poach these in exactly the same way as for <i>matelote</i>, but with
white wine and paprika seasoning. Let them cool in their
cooking-liquor; cut the pieces lengthwise into large fillets, and
cover them with the liquor after all grease has been removed
therefrom and it has been clarified and cleared.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="310—Eel au Vert"><a id="rcp.310"
 >310—EEL AU VERT</a></h3>

<p>Stew in butter two oz. of sorrel, one-quarter oz. of parsley,
as much chervil, a few tarragon leaves, a little fresh pimpernel,
two oz. of tender nettle, one-quarter oz. of savory, a sprig of
green thyme, and a few sage-leaves, all of which must be
<i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i>. Remove the skins from two lbs. of small eels, suppress
the heads, and cut into pieces two inches long. Put
these pieces with the herbs, stiffen them well, and add one pint
of white wine and a little salt and pepper. Set to cook for ten
minutes, thicken with the yolks of four eggs and a few drops
of lemon-juice, and leave to cool in a bowl. This preparation
of eel is served very cold.</p>

 >311—EEL AU VERT <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Remove the skin from, and cut into small pieces, two lbs.
of small eels. Stiffen the pieces in butter, moisten with one
pint of beer, season, and set to cook for ten minutes. Add the
herbs enumerated above, raw and roughly chopped. Once
more set to cook for seven or eight minutes, thicken with
fecula if the sauce is too thin, and transfer the whole to a bowl
to cool. Serve very cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="312—Artichokes à la Grecque"><a id="rcp.312"
 >312—ARTICHOKES <span class="nw">A LA GRECQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>Take some very small and tender artichokes. Pare them,
cut the leaves short, and plunge them into a large saucepan
of acidulated water. Set to parboil for eight or ten minutes,
drain, cool in fresh water, and drain once more in a sieve.</p>

<p>For twenty artichokes prepare the following <span class="nw">liquor:—</span>one
pint of water, one-quarter pint of oil, a little salt, the juice of
three lemons, a few fennel and coriander seeds, some peppercorns,
a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf. Set to boil, add the
parboiled artichokes, and leave to cook for twenty minutes.
Transfer to a bowl.</p>

<p>Serve these artichokes very cold upon a hors-d’œuvre
dish, accompanied by a few tablespoonfuls of their cooking-liquor.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="313—Small Artichoke-bottoms"><a id="rcp.313"
 >313—SMALL ARTICHOKE-BOTTOMS</a></h3>

<p>Remove the leaves and the hearts of some little artichokes;
trim their remaining bases, and plunge each as soon as trimmed
into acidulated water lest they blacken. Cook them “au
blanc” (No. <a href="#rcp.167">167</a>), and leave them to cool in their liquor.</p>

<p>Drain them well, dry them, place them in a pan, and
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> them for twenty minutes in oil and lemon-juice. This
done, garnish them, either with a <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> thickened with
mayonnaise, a milt or other purée, a small <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoine</a></i>, or a
vegetable salad, &amp;c. Place on a hors-d’œuvre dish with a
garnish of parsley sprays.</p>

<p>These are a kind of small <a href="#g_croustade">Croustades</a> with indented edges,
made in very small, boat-shaped moulds, and they may be
garnished in any conceivable way.</p>

<p>As their preparation is the same as that of Tartlets, see the
latter (No. <a href="#rcp.387">387</a>); also refer to “Frivolities” (No. <a href="#rcp.350">350</a>).</p>

 >315—SMOKED HAMBURG BEEF</a></h3>

<p>Cut it into very thin slices; divide these up into triangles,
and roll the latter into the shape of cones. The slices may also
be served flat.</p>

<p>Dish up at the last moment, and serve very cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="316—Canapés and Toast" id="g_canape"><a id="rcp.316"
 >316—CANAPÉS AND TOAST</a></h3>

<p>In the matter of hors-d’œuvres, the two above names have
the same meaning. The preparation consists of small slices
of the crumb of bread, about one-quarter inch thick, slightly
toasted and with a garnish on one of their sides. The garnish
is subject to the taste of the consumer, the resources at the
disposal of the cook, or the latter’s fancy, which may here be
fully indulged.</p>

<p>But the garnish, par excellence, for Canapés or Toast, is
fresh butter combined with a fine mince of white roast chicken-meat,
the meat of shell-fish or fish, or cheese, &amp;c., as I pointed
out above under the butters for hors-d’œuvres.</p>

<p>Whatever be the garnish of Canapés or Toast, and even
when it would be unreasonable to let butter form a part of it,
as, for example, in the case of <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> fish, anchovies,
filleted herring, &amp;c., it is always best to put plenty of butter
on the pieces of toast while they are still hot, with the view
of keeping them soft.</p>

<p>When the garnish consists of a purée, <i>i.e.</i>, a compound
butter, I should advise the use of a piping-bag fitted with a
grooved pipe, for laying the preparation upon the toast. This
method is both clean and expeditious, and lends itself to any
fanciful arrangement which the varying shape of the toast may
suggest.</p>

<p>The principal shapes given to the toast are as follows:
round, square, rectangular, oval, triangular, crescented, star-like,
crossed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They should never exceed one and one-half inches in
diameter, and a corresponding size in the other shapes.</p>

<p>I shall only indicate here a few kinds of specially garnished
toast, and leave the thousand and one other kinds for
the operator himself to discover.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="317—Anchovy Toast"><a id="rcp.317"
 >317—ANCHOVY TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast oval. Cover with anchovy butter,
and place thereon, lattice-wise, some fillets of anchovy cut to
the length of the toast. Garnish the pieces of toast all round
<a id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with the separately chopped whites and yolks of hard-boiled
eggs, alternating the colours.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="318—Caviare Toast"><a id="rcp.318"
 >318—CAVIARE TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast round; cover with caviare butter;
garnish the edges with a thread of softened butter, laid on by
means of a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe. Put fresh
caviare in the centre.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="319—Shrimp Toast"><a id="rcp.319"
 >319—SHRIMP TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast round; cover with shrimp butter,
and garnish by means of a border composed of shelled shrimps’
tails with a caper in the centre.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="320—City Toast"><a id="rcp.320"
 >320—CITY TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast round, and cover with a thick
coating of the following preparation, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span>Four oz. of fresh
butter, softened; two oz. of fresh Gruyère and two oz. of
Parmesan, both grated; a dessertspoonful of cream, and a little
salt and cayenne. Cover this preparation with two half-discs,
which when juxtaposed are equal in circumference to the round
of the toast. The half-discs should be cut respectively from
a Lyons sausage and a Gruyère cheese; both should be thin,
and equal in thickness.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="321—Danish Toast"><a id="rcp.321"
 >321—DANISH TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some slices of brown bread, equal in thickness to
the toast; but only heat, do not grill them. Spread some horse-radish
butter over them, and cover with alternate strips of
smoked salmon, caviare, and filleted herrings <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> in
white wine. Now stamp the garnished slices with a sharp
fancy-cutter, the shape of which is optional.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="322—Crayfish Toast"><a id="rcp.322"
 >322—CRAYFISH TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast crescented; cover with crayfish
butter, deck the edges with a string of softened butter, and
garnish with a crayfish’s tail, cut into two lengthwise.<!-- TN: period invisible --> The
two halves of the tail should be placed in the middle of each
crescent, close together and with their thickest side innermost.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="323—Tongue Toast"><a id="rcp.323"
 >323—TONGUE TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some slices of crumb of bread, equal in thickness,
and toast them. Now garnish with a coating, half as thick
<a id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as the slices themselves, of mustard butter. Cover the butter
with thin slices of very red, salted tongue, and let the butter
harden.</p>

<p>Stamp out the pieces of toast with a star-shaped fancy-cutter,
which should be dipped from time to time in boiling water in
order to facilitate the operation. Finally, make a rosette of
mustard butter in the middle of each piece of toast.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="324—Lucile Toast"><a id="rcp.324"
 >324—LUCILE TOAST</a></h3>

<p>Make the pieces of toast oval, cover with mustard butter,
and border their edges with a line of finely chopped and very
red tongue. Garnish the middle of each with chopped white
chicken-meat, and in the centre drop a pinch of chopped truffle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="325—Various Carolines"><a id="rcp.325"
 >325—VARIOUS CAROLINES</a></h3>

<p>These are very small éclairs of <i><a href="#g_pate_a_choux">pâte à choux</a></i> without sugar.
When quite cold, garnish them inside with a purée, either of
tongue, fowl, game, or foie gras, &amp;c., then coat them
thinly with a chaud-froid sauce in keeping with the purée forming
the inside garnish.</p>

<p>When the sauce has cooled, glaze it, by means of a brush,
with a little cold melted jelly, with a view to making it glossy.</p>

<p>N.B.—Carolines are also used as a garnish for certain cold
preparations, aspics, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="326—Caviare and Blinis"><a id="rcp.326"
 >326—CAVIARE AND BLINIS</a></h3>

<p>Caviare is undoubtedly the richest and most delicate of
hors-d’œuvres, granted, of course, that it be of good quality
and consist of large, light-coloured, and transparent particles.
Its price is always high, owing to the difficulty attending its
importation. It is served very simply, either in a silver timbale
or in its original receptacle, surrounded with ice, and
accompanied by a dish of Blinis, whereof the preparation is as
<span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Make a thin paste with one oz. of yeast and one lb. of
sifted flour diluted with one pint of lukewarm milk. Leave
this paste to ferment for two hours in a lukewarm atmosphere,
and then add thereto one-half lb. of flour, the yolks of four
eggs, a pinch of salt, one-half pint of tepid milk; mix the
whole without letting it acquire any body, and finally add the
whites of four eggs, whisked. Let the preparation ferment
for half an hour, and, when about to serve, cook the Blinis
quickly, after the manner of pancakes, in special little omelet-pans.
Dish them up very hot on a napkin.</p>

<p><a id="png.166" href="#png.166"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Failing fresh caviare, the pressed and salted kind may also
be used for hors-d’œuvres. Some cooks serve finely-chopped
onions with fresh caviare, but a worse practice could not be
imagined. Fresh caviare, the flavour of which is perfect, does
not need any supplementary condiment.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="327—Celery “A la Bonne-femme”"><a id="rcp.327"
 >327—CELERY “A LA BONNE-FEMME”</a></h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of very tender celery sticks and peeled,
quartered and cored russet apples. Finely mince the celery and
apples, season with a mustard-and-cream sauce, and place on
a hors-d’œuvre dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="328—Celery à la Grecque"><a id="rcp.328"
 >328—CELERY <span class="nw">A LA GRECQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select a few hearts of celery, very equal; trim, wash, and
parboil them in acidulated water, as directed under “artichokes
à la Grecque.” Prepare the cooking-liquor from the
same ingredients, using the same quantities thereof, and cook
similarly.</p>

<p>Serve very cold on a crystal hors-d’œuvre dish with a portion
of the cooking-liquor.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="329—Celeriac"><a id="rcp.329"
 >329—CELERIAC</a></h3>

<p>Quarter, peel, and cut the vegetable in <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> fashion.
Prepare the seasoning with mustard, salt, pepper, and vinegar;
add the <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of Celeriac and mix thoroughly. When the
roots are quite soft, a seasoning consisting of mustard-and-cream
sauce is preferable.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="329a—Marinaded Cèpes"><a id="rcp.329a"
 >329a—MARINADED CÈPES</a></h3>

<p>Select some very small and fresh <i><a href="#g_cepes">cèpes</a></i>. Parboil them for
eight minutes, drain and cool them, put them into a basin,
and cover them with the boiling <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> after having passed
the latter through a strainer.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a> for Two lbs. of <a href="#g_cepes">Cèpes</a>.</i>—Put into a saucepan one
pint of vinegar, one-third pint of oil, a crushed clove of garlic,
a fragment of bay, and a little thyme, six peppercorns, a pinch
of coriander, a few fennel leaves, and a small root of parsley.
Set to boil for five minutes. Leave the mushrooms to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>

<h3 class="recipe" title="329b—Cherries à l’Allemande"><a id="rcp.329b"
 >329b—CHERRIES <span class="nw">A L’ALLEMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Take five lbs. of Morella cherries, put them into a bottle, as
in the case of cherry brandy, and add thereto three cloves, a
<a id="png.167" href="#png.167"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fragment of cinnamon, some grated nutmeg, and a sprig of
tarragon. Pour over the cherries two quarts of vinegar, boiled
with one-half lb. of brown sugar and properly cooled. Cork
the bottle, and leave the fruit to macerate for a fortnight.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="329c—Brains à la Robert"><a id="rcp.329c"
 >329c—BRAINS <span class="nw">A LA ROBERT</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook well-cleansed sheep’s or lamb’s brains in <i>court-bouillon</i>,
and cool. Divide them up into thin and regular slices,
and place them on a hors-d’œuvre dish. Rub the brain remains
through a fine sieve, combine the resulting purée with
a mustard-and-cream sauce, and add thereto a fine <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of
the white part only of celery.</p>

<p>Cover the slices of brain with the sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="329d—Cucumber à la Danoise"><a id="rcp.329d"
 >329d—CUCUMBER <span class="nw">A LA DANOISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut the cucumber to the shape of small <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> or <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>,
<i><a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a></i> and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> them.</p>

<p>Garnish with a preparation composed of a purée of salmon
mixed with fillets of herring and chopped, hard-boiled eggs in
equal quantities.</p>

<p>Sprinkle a little chopped horse-radish over the garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="330—Stuffed Cucumbers"><a id="rcp.330"
 >330—STUFFED CUCUMBERS</a></h3>

<p>Prepare them as above, in the shape of small <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a> or
<i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i>. Cook them, at the same time keeping them firm;
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> them for twenty minutes, when they are quite cold, in
oil and vinegar, and garnish them, by means of a piping-bag,
either with a thick purée, some mince-meat thickened with
mayonnaise, or a small vegetable <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoine</a></i>, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="331—Cucumber Salad"><a id="rcp.331"
 >331—CUCUMBER SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Carefully peel the cucumbers, cut them into two lengthwise,
remove their seeds, and mince finely. Place them in a bowl,
sprinkle with table-salt, and leave them to exude their vegetable
moisture for twenty-five minutes. This done, drain them, press
them in a towel, season with pepper, oil, and vinegar, and add
some chopped chervil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="332—Cucumber and Pimento Salad"><a id="rcp.332"
 >332—CUCUMBER AND PIMENTO SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Select some very fresh, medium-sized cucumbers, peel them,
and cut them into pieces two inches in length. Cut these pieces
spirally, beginning at their peripheries and working towards
their centres; then cut them diametrally, so as to produce curved
<a id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>strips of the vegetable. Add an equal quantity of pimentos cut
into strips, and season as in the case of cucumber salad.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="333—York Cones"><a id="rcp.333"
 >333—YORK CONES</a></h3>

<p>Cut slices from a York ham as thinly as possible, and trim
them to the shape of triangles. Roll the triangles into cones,
and garnish their insides (by means of a piping-bag fitted with
a grooved pipe) with any butter or cream. (See Nos. <a href="#rcp.280">280</a> to

<p>Prepare a hors-d’œuvre cream in accordance with any one
of the recipes (Nos. <a href="#rcp.294">294</a> to <a href="#rcp.299">299</a>). Put this cream into very
small, slightly-oiled, and ornamented moulds, and leave it to
set in the cool or on ice. Empty the moulds, at the moment
of dishing up, either directly upon a dish, on tartlets garnished
with a purée in keeping with the cream, or on toast. With
these moulded creams, endless varieties of delicate and recommendable
little hors-d’œuvres may be prepared, while in their
preparation the moulds used in pastry for “petits fours” may
serve a useful purpose.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="336—Shrimps and Prawns"><a id="rcp.336"
 >336—SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS</a></h3>

<p>Get these very fresh and serve them on boat-shaped hors-d’œuvre

parsley, or lay the crustacean directly upon parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="337—Duchesses"><a id="rcp.337"
 >337—DUCHESSES</a></h3>

<p>This hors-d’œuvre is almost equivalent to the Carolines
(No. <a href="#rcp.325">325</a>), except that the shape of the Duchesses is that of
little <i><a href="#g_choux">choux</a></i>, about the size of a pigeon’s egg, and that, as a
rule, they are merely glazed with some melted jelly, and not

the oil, per pint (which quantity should be allowed for every
two lbs. of the fish), eight unpeeled garlic-cloves, an onion,
and a carrot cut into thin, round slices, all of which vegetables
should be slightly fried. Drain off the oil, moisten with one-quarter
pint of vinegar and as much water, and season with a
little salt, two small pimentos, a small bay-leaf, a sprig of
thyme, and a few parsley stalks. Dip the smelts for twelve

<p>I adopted the above term for those small, light, and elegant
little preparations, the radical types whereof are <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a> and
tartlets, which often take the place of hors-d’œuvres on a menu.
The term seems plain, clear, and explicit, and no other could

<p>For various reasons, I thought it best, in the past, to substitute
the mythological name “Nymphs” for the more vulgar
term “Frogs” on menus, and the former has been universally
adopted, more particularly in reference to the following
“Chaud-froid <span class="nw">à l’Aurore”:—</span></p>

<p>Poach the frogs’ legs in an excellent white-wine <i>court-bouillon</i>.
When cooled, trim them properly, dry them thoroughly
in a piece of fine linen, and steep them, one after
the other, in a chaud-froid sauce of fish with paprika, the tint
of which should be golden. This done, arrange the treated
legs on a layer of champagne jelly, which should have set
beforehand on the bottom of a square, silver dish or crystal
bowl. Now lay some chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a> and tarragon leaves between
the legs in imitation of water-grasses, and cover the whole
with champagne jelly to counterfeit the effect of water.</p>

slices, half a carrot cut into grooved roundels, a faggot,
the necessary salt, and a few peppercorns. Set to boil gently
for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Place the cleaned herrings in a sauté-pan, pour the boiling
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> upon them, and let them poach for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Prepare a sauce as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Beat up the yolks of two eggs
in a bowl with salt and pepper and one tablespoonful of
mustard; add five tablespoonfuls of oil and two of vinegar,
proceeding as in the case of mayonnaise, and complete with
shallots and one dessertspoonful of chopped chervil and
gherkins. Season with cayenne, immerse the drained and dried

cut into dice, parsley, chervil, and chopped fennel and tarragon.
Season with oil and vinegar, salt and pepper; make the preparation
into shapes resembling herrings, and place the heads

 >356—HERRINGS <span class="nw">A LA RUSSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut some fine, cleaned fillets of salted herrings into thin
slices. Dish up, and alternate the rows of sliced fillets with
<a id="png.172" href="#png.172"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rows of sliced, cold, boiled potatoes. Season with oil and
vinegar, and finish up with chopped chervil, fennel, tarragon,
and shallots.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="357—Herrings with French Beans"><a id="rcp.357"
 >357—HERRINGS WITH FRENCH BEANS</a></h3>

<p>These hors-d’œuvres can only be served at their best in
the months of September and October, when the first shoals
of herrings begin to appear. Dutch fishermen know of a means
of salting and <i>marinading</i> this fish, which greatly increases
its value, and it is not unusual to pay as much as two or three
shillings for one in the early part of the season. They can only
be kept a few days, but they form an excellent dish, and their
flavour is exquisite. Before serving them, it is only needful
to skin them, whereupon they may be dished up with a little
chopped parsley. Send a bowl of French beans to the table
with them, the vegetables having been freshly cooked, kept
somewhat firm, buttered, and not cooled. Some cooks serve
the beans cold, in the form of a salad, but as a rule they are
preferred hot with butter, while the herrings should be very
cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="358—Oysters"><a id="rcp.358"
 >358—OYSTERS</a></h3>

<p>The best oysters to be had are those of Whitstable, Colchester,
Burnham, and Zeeland. The green, French Marennes,
which might equal the above, are not favoured by everyone on
account of their colour. Ostend oysters are also excellent, but
they are neither as delicate nor as fleshy as the English ones.</p>

<p>Oysters are the dish par excellence; their delicacy satisfies
the most fastidious of epicures, and they are so easily digested
that the most delicate invalid can partake of them freely. With
the exception of caviare, they are the only hors-d’œuvres which
should ever appear on the menu of a well-ordered dinner.</p>

<p>Oysters ought to be served very cold; hence the prevailing
custom of dishing them on ice. In England they are served
plain on the flat half of the shell, whereas in France and elsewhere
they are left in the hollow half, which is better calculated
to retain the natural liquor of the oyster, held in high esteem
by many. Send some slices of brown bread and butter to the
table with the oysters.</p>

<p>The various methods of treating oysters will be given hereafter
in the chapter dealing with fish. I have given them
merely because consumers and caterers alike may wish to have
them; but the real and best way of serving oysters is to send
them to the table raw.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="359—Ardennes Ham"><a id="png.173" href="#png.173"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]<br

 >359—ARDENNES HAM</a></h3>

<p>This is served like smoked breast of goose, cut, raw, into
thin and even slices.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="360—Cantaloup Melon"><a id="rcp.360"
 >360—CANTALOUP MELON</a></h3>

<p>Melon makes an excellent hors-d’œuvre for summer
luncheons. It should be just ripe, and have a nice perfume.
Serve it as fresh as possible.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="361—English Melons"><a id="rcp.361"
 >361—ENGLISH MELONS</a></h3>

<p>The English variety of melons is inferior in quality to the
French.</p>

<p>Their shape is oval, their peel is yellow, thin, and smooth,
and their pulp, which is white, more nearly resembles the
water-melon than the melon in flavour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="362—Melon with Port, Marsala, or Sherry, etc."><a id="rcp.362"
 >362—MELON WITH PORT, MARSALA, OR <span class="nw">SHERRY, &amp;c.</span></a></h3>

<p>Select a Cantaloup or other melon of the same kind as the
former, and let it be just ripe. Make a round incision about
the stalk, three inches in diameter; withdraw the plug thus
cut, and through the resulting hole thoroughly remove all the
pips by means of a silver spoon.</p>

<p>Now pour one-half pint of best Port, Marsala, or Sherry
into the melon, replace the plug, and keep the melon for two
or three hours in a cooler surrounded by broken ice. Do not
cut the melon into slices when serving it. It should be taken
to the table, whole, and then the piece containing the stalk
is withdrawn and the fruit is cut into shell-like slices with a
silver spoon, and served with a little of the accompanying wine
upon iced plates.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="363—Various Melons"><a id="rcp.363"
 >363—VARIOUS MELONS</a></h3>

<p>France produces a large variety of melons, of which the
principal kinds are the Sucrins of Tours, the St. Laud melon,
the black melons of the Carmes, &amp;c. They are all excellent,
and are served like the Cantaloups.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="364—Natives with Caviare"><a id="rcp.364"
 >364—NATIVES WITH CAVIARE</a></h3>

<p>This is a typically luxurious hors-d’œuvre. Cook some
little tartlet crusts for hors-d’œuvre (No. <a href="#rcp.387">387</a>). When about
to dish up, garnish these with a tablespoonful of fine, fresh
caviare; make a hollow in the latter and place therein a fine
Whitstable oyster (cleared of its beard), seasoned with a little
powdered pepper and a drop of lemon-juice.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="365—Smoked Breast of Goose"><a id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum"><span

 >365—SMOKED BREAST OF GOOSE</a></h3>

<p>Cut it into the thinnest possible slices, and garnish with
very green parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="366—Plain Olives"><a id="rcp.366"
 >366—PLAIN OLIVES</a></h3>

<p>Olives of all kinds are suitable for hors-d’œuvres, and they
are served plain. Three or four varieties are known, all of
which are excellent, provided they be fleshy, firm, very green,
and moderately salted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="367—Stuffed Olives"><a id="rcp.367"
 >367—STUFFED OLIVES</a></h3>

<p>For this purpose, select large Spanish olives and stone them,
either by cutting them spirally, or by means of a special
machine. In the place of the stone, put one of the butters or
creams for hors-d’œuvres (Nos. <a href="#rcp.280">280</a> to <a href="#rcp.299">299</a>). Before serving
these olives, it is well to let them rest awhile in a moderately
warm atmosphere. For, since stuffed olives are generally kept
in the cool, immersed in oil with which they become thoroughly
saturated, it follows that the moment they are put into contact
with a slightly higher temperature they will exude that oil.
Wherefore, if the above precaution were not observed, by the
time the olives reached the table they would, more often than
not, be swimming in oil, when they would be neither nice nor
appetising.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="368—Plain Lapwings’ and Plovers’ Eggs"><a id="rcp.368"
 >368—PLAIN LAPWINGS’ AND PLOVERS’ EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Though the lapwing and the plover are different in respect
of their plumage, they are, nevertheless, birds of similar
habits and haunts, and their eggs are remarkably alike. The
latter, which are a little larger than pigeons’ eggs, have a light-green
shell covered with black spots.</p>

<p>When cooked, the albuminous portions acquire a milky
colour, and never assume the solidity of the whites of other
eggs.</p>

<p>When served as a hors-d’œuvre, these eggs are always
boiled hard. Put them in a saucepan of cold water, and leave
them to cook for eight minutes after the boil is reached. Cool
them, shell their pointed ends, and serve them in a nest composed
of watercress or curled-leaf parsley.</p>

<p>N.B.—Test the freshness of the eggs before boiling them
by plunging them in a bowl of cold water. If they float, their
freshness is doubtful, and they should be discarded.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="369—Lapwings’ Eggs in Aspic"><a id="png.175" href="#png.175"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>157<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.369"
 >369—LAPWINGS’ EGGS IN ASPIC</a></h3>

<p>Decorate a border-mould according to taste, and let a
thin coating of very clear aspic jelly set on the bottom of the
utensil. Besprinkle the articles used in decorating with a few
drops of melted jelly, in order to keep them from shifting;
then cover them with a few tablespoonfuls of jelly, and let it
set. On this coating of jelly arrange the shelled, hard-boiled
lapwings’ eggs with their points downwards, so that they
may appear upright when the aspic is withdrawn from the
mould. Fill up the mould by means of successive layers of
melted jelly.</p>

<p>When about to serve, dip the mould into hot water; quickly
wipe it, and then turn the aspic out on to a folded napkin lying
on a dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="370—Lapwings’ Eggs à la Moderne"><a id="rcp.370"
 >370—LAPWINGS’ EGGS <span class="nw">A LA MODERNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Boil the eggs soft; mould them in <i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>, coated
with jelly, and garnished in <a href="#g_chartreuse"><i>Chartreuse</i> fashion</a>. Heap a
vegetable-salad, thickened with mayonnaise, in the middle of
the dish, and place the eggs removed from their moulds all
round.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="371—Lapwings’ Eggs à la Christiana"><a id="rcp.371"
 >371—LAPWINGS’ EGGS <span class="nw">A LA CHRISTIANA</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook the eggs as above; shell them; slice a piece off their
thicker ends to make them stand, and arrange them on a dish,
placing them upon little tartlet-crusts, garnished with a foie-gras
purée.</p>

<p>For twelve eggs put two tablespoonfuls of foie-gras purée
in a small saucepan; add thereto one tablespoonful of chopped
truffles and as much melted jelly, the latter with a view to
making the preparation more liquid. Take some of this preparation
in a tablespoon and pour it over the eggs, taking
care that each of these gets well covered with it. Let the
coating set in the cool, and dish up the tartlets on a napkin,
arranging them in the form of a circle with curled-leaf parsley
as a centre-garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="372—Lapwings’ Eggs à la Moscovite"><a id="rcp.372"
 >372—LAPWINGS’ EGGS <span class="nw">A LA MOSCOVITE</span></a></h3>

<p>Boil the eggs hard; cool and shell them. Prepare as many
tartlet-crusts as there are eggs. When dishing up, garnish
the tartlets with a coffeespoonful of caviare, and place one
egg in the middle of each.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="373—Various Hard-boiled Eggs"><a id="png.176" href="#png.176"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.373"
 >373—VARIOUS HARD-BOILED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>With hard-boiled eggs for base, a large number of hors-d’œuvres
may be made. I shall limit myself to a few only,
which, by means of a small change in their form, garnish, or
ornamentation, may be varied at <span class="nw">will:—</span></p>

<p><i>Egg Discs.</i>—Cut the eggs laterally into roundels one-third
inch in thickness, and discard the two end-pieces of each egg,
in order that the shapes may be almost uniform, and that the
yolks may appear about the same size throughout. In the
centre of each roundel make a little rosette of butter, by means
of a small, grooved pipe. Different butters, such as the
Shrimp, Montpellier, Caviare, and other kinds, may be used
with the view of varying the colours.</p>

<p><i>Halved, Stuffed Eggs.</i>—Take some very small, hard-boiled
eggs; cut them into two, lengthwise; remove the yolks, and
trim the oval hollow of each of the remaining whites to the
shape of an oblong, the edges of which may then be indented.</p>

<p><i>Garnish</i>, either with a purée of tunny, salmon, milt, &amp;c.,
or a hash or <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of lobster, shrimp, &amp;c., thickened by
means of a mayonnaise with jelly, or a fine <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoine</a></i> of vegetables
with mayonnaise, or a purée composed of the withdrawn
yolks combined with a little butter, some cold Béchamel sauce,
and herbs.</p>

<p><i>Quartered, Stuffed Eggs.</i>—The simplest way of doing this
is to proceed as above; to stuff the halved white with a buttered
purée, or a purée mixed with jelly, to leave the stuffing to set,
and then to cut the halves in two.</p>

<p><i>Salad of Eggs.</i>—With alternate rows of sliced eggs and
either tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, or beetroot, and a salad-seasoning
composed of oil and vinegar or cream, a dozen
different salads may be prepared, each of which constitutes an
excellent hors-d’œuvre.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="374—Lark Pâte"><a id="rcp.374"
 >374—LARK PÂTE</a></h3>

<p>For this hors-d’œuvre use the ready-made pâte, which is
obtained either in pots or crusts. Thoroughly set it by means
of ice; turn it out of its receptacle, cut it into very small and
thin slices, and arrange them on a hors-d’œuvre dish with a
little broken jelly in the middle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="375—Mild, Grilled Capsicum"><a id="rcp.375"
 >375—MILD, GRILLED CAPSICUM</a></h3>

<p>Grill the capsicum on a moderate fire until the skins are
so scorched as to be easily removed.</p>

<p><a id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>159<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Now cut them up <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>, and season with oil and
vinegar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="376—Radishes"><a id="rcp.376"
 >376—RADISHES</a></h3>

<p>In the preparation of hors-d’œuvres by the kitchen, radishes
are used chiefly as a garnish. When they constitute a hors-d’œuvre
of themselves, their preparation is relegated to the
pantry.</p>

<p>They are used especially in imitating the pendulous flowers
of the fuchsia; sometimes, too, they are sliced and placed on
cut cucumber to form a dish-border; but their uses in garnishing
are as numerous as they are various.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="377—American Relishes"><a id="rcp.377"
 >377—AMERICAN RELISHES</a></h3>

<p>These consist of divers kinds of fruit and of small onions
and gherkins, prepared with vinegar, seasoned with sugar and
cinnamon, and flavoured with cayenne.</p>

<p>They resemble what the Italians call “Aceto-dolce.” This
hors-d’œuvre is accompanied by special cinnamon biscuits,
and remains on the table throughout the meal.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="378—Rillettes and Rillons"><a id="rcp.378"
 >378—RILLETTES AND RILLONS</a></h3>

<p>Both these preparations, which belong to the province of
the pork-butcher, may be found on the market.</p>

<p>The rillettes are served in their pots, and are always sent
to the table very cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="379—Red Mullet à l’Orientale"><a id="rcp.379"
 >379—RED MULLET <span class="nw">A L’ORIENTALE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select small ones, as far as possible. Place them in an
oiled pan, and add peeled and <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> tomatoes, parsley-root,
fennel, thyme, bay, a little garlic, peppercorns, coriander,
and saffron, the latter being the dominating ingredient.</p>

<p>Cover the whole with white wine; salt moderately, set to
boil, and then leave to poach on the side of the fire for twelve
or eighteen minutes, in accordance with the size of the mullet.</p>

<p>Leave the fish to cool in their cooking-liquor, and serve
them with a little of the latter and a few slices of peeled lemon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="380—Sardines"><a id="rcp.380"
 >380—SARDINES</a></h3>

<p>The various kinds of sardines for hors-d’œuvres may be
found on the market.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="381—Salads"><a id="rcp.381"
 >381—SALADS</a></h3>

<p>Salads for hors-d’œuvres may consist of an endless diversity
of products, and their preparation varies so that it would be
<a id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>impossible to prescribe fixed rules for the latter. I shall therefore
restrict myself to saying merely that they should be made
as light and as sightly as possible, in order that they may be
in keeping with the general idea and purpose of hors-d’œuvre.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="382—Gotha and Milan Salami"><a id="rcp.382"
 >382—GOTHA AND MILAN SALAMI</a></h3>

<p>Cut these into very thin slices, and place them, one on top
of the other, on a hors-d’œuvre dish, in the form of a crown,
with a sprig of curled-leaf parsley in the middle. They may
also be laid flat upon a litter of parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="383—Arles, Bologne or Large Lyons Sausages"><a id="rcp.383"
 >383—ARLES, BOLOGNE OR LARGE LYONS SAUSAGES</a></h3>

<p>Cut these up and arrange them like the Salami.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="384—Foie-gras Sausages"><a id="rcp.384"
 >384—FOIE-GRAS SAUSAGES</a></h3>

<p>Cut into thin roundels and dish up with chopped aspic jelly
as a centre-garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="385—Smoked Salmon"><a id="rcp.385"
 >385—SMOKED SALMON</a></h3>

<p>Cut into triangular, thin slices; roll these into cones, and
arrange in the form of a crown with curled-leaf parsley in the
middle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="386—Sprats"><a id="rcp.386"
 >386—SPRATS</a></h3>

<p>These are smoked sardines. Select the very fleshy ones,
for there exist many kinds, a few of which are dry and quite
flavourless.</p>

<p>In order to prepare them, suppress the heads and remove
or leave on the skins, in accordance with the consumer’s taste.
Put them on a dish with some finely-chopped shallots, chopped
parsley, and oil and vinegar, using a very little of each ingredient.
Leave them to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for five or six hours, taking
care to turn them over from time to time so as to thoroughly
saturate them with the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="387—Tartlets and Barquettes"><a id="rcp.387"
 >387—TARTLETS AND BARQUETTES</a></h3>

<p>These articles play an important part in the service of hors-d’œuvres,
and represent the class I designated under the name
of <i>Frivolities</i>.</p>

<p>The garnishes suitable for tartlets are likewise used with
<a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>, the latter only differing from the former in their
shape. The directions which follow below, and which should
be carefully noted, apply equally to both.</p>

<p><a id="png.179" href="#png.179"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Special Paste for Tartlets and Barquettes.</i>—Sift one lb. of
flour on to a mixing-board; make a hole in the centre, into
which put one-eighth oz. of salt, one-half lb. of cold, melted
butter, one egg, the yolks of two, and a few drops of water.
Mix the whole into a paste, handling it as little as possible;
roll it into a ball, and put it aside in the cool for two hours.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of Tartlet- and Barquette-crusts.</i>—Roll out
the paste to the thickness of one-eighth inch, and stamp it with
an indented fancy-cutter into pieces of the same size as the
tartlet-moulds to be used, which in this case are the same as for
“<i>petits fours</i>,” and, therefore, very small.</p>

<p>The fancy-cutter should be round for tartlets, and oval for
<a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>. Lay the paste in the moulds, prick the parts lying
on the bottom, lest they should blister, garnish the insides with
pieces of kitchen-paper to protect the paste, and fill them with
rice or flour. Bake in a moderate oven; remove the rice or
flour, the sole object of which was to preserve the shape of the
tartlets or <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>; turn the latter out of their moulds, and
set them to cool.</p>

<p><i>The Garnishes of Tartlets and <a href="#g_barquettes">Barquettes</a>.</i>—These may be
divided into two classes, viz., (1) those with a compound butter
for base, (2) those with an aspic jelly base.</p>

<p>The first class comprises all the garnishes I gave for <a href="#g_canape"><i>Canapés</i></a>
and Toast, as also all those which the operator’s fancy, taste,
and inventiveness may devise.</p>

<p>The second class generally consists of a layer, on the bottom,
of some kind of <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, upon which a whole piece of a different
colour from the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> is placed, and which is then coated
with a very clear jelly.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i>—Garnish the bottom of a tartlet or <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquette</i></a> with
a coating of pink, shrimp, crayfish or lobster <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>. Upon
this lay a very white poached oyster, or a slice of hard-boiled
egg, stamped with an indented fancy-cutter. In the centre of
the yolk put a little lobster coral, and coat the whole with jelly
to the level of the tartlet edges.</p>

<p>The explanations given above warrant my refraining from
a more detailed discussion of these delicate preparations. Sufficient
has been said to allow of any operator, with a little taste
and inventiveness, easily making an endless variety of combinations.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="388—Tunny in Oil"><a id="rcp.388"
 >388—TUNNY IN OIL</a></h3>

<p>This is found on the market, and it may be served as it
stands. It is very greatly used as a garnish for hors-d’œuvres.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="389—Tunny with Tomatoes"><a id="png.180" href="#png.180"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]<br

 >389—TUNNY WITH TOMATOES</a></h3>

<p>Lay alternate slices of tunny and tomato upon a hors-d’œuvre
dish, and between each slice lay a thin round of onion.
Garnish the edge of the dish with a border composed of sliced
potato, and sprinkle the whole with an ordinary salad
seasoning.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="390—Mock Tomatoes"><a id="rcp.390"
 >390—MOCK TOMATOES</a></h3>

<p>Select some about the size of a walnut, and peel them carefully.
Press them in a piece of linen, and set them to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>
for half an hour in oil and vinegar. Then stick a small piece
of parsley stalk into each tomato, in imitation of the stalk, and
surround it with little leaves made from green butter by means
of a small piping-bag.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="391—Tomatoes à l’Américaine"><a id="rcp.391"
 >391—TOMATOES <span class="nw">A L’AMÉRICAINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some firm, medium-sized tomatoes, and cut them into
thin slices. Put them into a dish with salt, pepper, oil, and
a few drops of vinegar, and leave them to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for twenty
minutes. Then arrange them on a hors-d’œuvre dish, garnishing
the border with fine rings of onion.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="392—Tomatoes à la Monégasque"><a id="rcp.392"
 >392—TOMATOES <span class="nw">A LA MONÉGASQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some small tomatoes about the size of walnuts, and
cut a slice from each in the region of the stalk. Squeeze out
all their water and seeds, and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> them, inside, for
twenty minutes. Prepare a mince of tunny with oil, and add
thereto, per two oz. of the fish, half a tablespoonful of finely-chopped
onion, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, chervil, and
tarragon, and a small, hard-boiled egg, also chopped.</p>

<p>Thicken the whole with a tablespoonful of thick mayonnaise;
put it into a bag fitted with a smooth, medium-sized
pipe, and garnish the tomatoes with the preparation, using
enough of the latter to form a kind of dome upon each tomato.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="393—Quartered Tomatoes"><a id="rcp.393"
 >393—QUARTERED TOMATOES</a></h3>

<p>Use medium-sized tomatoes, somewhat firm and with very
smooth skins. Peel them and empty them, and then fill them,
either with a fish purée cleared with jelly, or with a <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoine</a></i>
of vegetables thickened by means of a mayonnaise with jelly.
Place on ice for half an hour, and cut the tomatoes into
regular quarters. The tomatoes may also be cut into four,
previous to stuffing them, whereupon they may, with the help
<a id="png.181" href="#png.181"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe, be filled with one
of the compound butters.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="394—Marinaded Trout"><a id="rcp.394"
 >394—MARINADED TROUT</a></h3>

<p>Select some very small trout, clean and dress them, and
poach them in a white-wine <i>court-bouillon</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.164">164</a>) to which
vinegar has been added in the proportion of one-third of its
volume.</p>

<p>Leave the fish to cool in the liquor, and dish up with a few
tablespoonfuls of the latter, placing some thin, grooved slices
of lemon upon the fish.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Of</span> all the products put into requisition by the art of cookery,
not one is so fruitful of variety, so universally liked, and so
complete in itself as the egg. There are very few culinary
recipes that do not include eggs, either as a principal constituent
or as an ingredient.</p>

<p>The many and various egg-preparations constitute chiefly
breakfast or luncheon dishes; nevertheless, at a Lenten dinner
they may be served as entrées with advantage, for, at a time
when fish, shell-fish and water-game are the only resources
in this respect, eggs form a pleasant and welcome change.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="395—Eggs on the Dish" id="g_poele_2"><a id="rcp.395"
 >395—EGGS ON THE DISH</a></h3>

<p>Eggs cooked in this way derive all their quality from the
way in which the cooking process is conducted. They must
be evenly cooked, on top and underneath, and should remain
soft. An important condition of the process is that the eggs
should be exceedingly fresh. After having heated sufficient
butter in the dish to cover the whole of the bottom, break two
eggs into it, baste the yolks with a little very hot butter, salt
them slightly, and push them into the oven. As soon as the
white of the eggs assumes a milky-white colour, they are cooked
and should be withdrawn from the oven to be served immediately.</p>

<p>Great attention should be bestowed upon the cooking process,
a few seconds more or less than the required time being
sufficient to spoil the eggs. Special care ought to be taken
that they do not cook either too much or too quickly, for it
should be remembered that, even were the cooking checked
before the proper time, the heat of the dish does, to a certain
extent, make good the deficiency.</p>

<p>Eggs <i>à la poêle</i>, which, in England, are called “fried
eggs,” are a variety of eggs on the dish, very often served on
toast, or accompanied by sausages or fried bacon. They are
<a id="png.183" href="#png.183"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cooked in an omelet-pan, trimmed neatly with a fancy-cutter,
and placed, by means of a spatula, upon the prepared toast.</p>

<p>About one-half oz. of butter should be allowed for every
two eggs, which number constitutes the working-base of the
following recipes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="396—Bercy Eggs"><a id="rcp.396"
 >396—BERCY EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Put half of the butter to be used in a dish; let it melt, break
the eggs, taking care not to burst the yolks; baste the latter
with the rest of the butter, and season. Cook as directed—that
is to say, until the whites are quite done and the yolks are
glossy. Garnish with a small, grilled sausage, placed between
the yolks, and surround with a thread of tomato sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="397—Eggs with Brown Butter"><a id="rcp.397"

<p>There are two methods: (1) Cook the eggs in a dish as
usual, and then cover them with one-quarter oz. of brown butter
and a few drops of vinegar, which should be added after the
butter.</p>

<p>(2) Put one-half oz. of butter into a small omelet-pan,
and cook it until it is almost black. Break the eggs into it,
season, cook, tilt them gently on to a dish, and besprinkle with
a few drops of vinegar, with which the omelet-pan has been
rinsed.</p>

<h3 class="subhead" title="Poached and Soft-boiled Eggs">Poached and Soft-boiled Eggs</h3>

<p>All the recipes given hereafter apply equally to poached and
soft-boiled eggs, wherefore I shall only mention “poached”
in the titles, leaving soft-boiled to be understood.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="411—Procedure for Poached Eggs"><a id="rcp.411"
 >411—PROCEDURE FOR POACHED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>The one and only essential condition in this case is the
use of perfectly fresh eggs, for it is quite impossible to expect
an even poaching if this condition is not fulfilled.</p>

<p>(1) Have ready a sauté-pan containing boiling salted water
(one-third oz. of salt per quart of water), slightly acidulated with
vinegar. Break the eggs over that part of the water which is
actually boiling.</p>

<p><a id="png.186" href="#png.186"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>(2) In order that the eggs may poach freely, do not put more
than eight or ten at a time into the same sauté-pan; better even
poach them six at a time, for then the poaching will be effected
more equally.</p>

<p>(3) As soon as the eggs are in the water, let the latter
simmer. The egg is poached when the white has enveloped
the yolk, reassuming, as it were, the form of a raw egg, and
when it may be touched without breaking. The usual time
allowed for poaching is three minutes.</p>

<p>(4) Withdraw the eggs by means of a slice; dip them into
cold water, trim their whites, and put them back into moderately
warm water until ready to serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="412—The Cooking of Soft-boiled Eggs"><a id="rcp.412"
 >412—THE COOKING OF SOFT-BOILED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>These ought to be very fresh, as in the case of poached
eggs. With a view to equalising their cooking, it is a good
plan to put them in a colander perforated with large holes,
whereby they may be plunged into and withdrawn from the
water together. Keep the water boiling; plunge the eggs
therein as directed; leave them to cook for six minutes from
the time the water has regained the boiling-point; drain, steep
for a moment in a bowl of cold water, and shell the eggs carefully.
Keep them in moderately-salted hot water until ready
to serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="413—The Dishing of Poached and Soft-boiled Eggs"><a id="rcp.413"
 >413—THE DISHING OF POACHED AND <span class="nw">SOFT-BOILED EGGS</span></a></h3>

<p>There are many ways of doing this, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span></p>

<p>(1) On rusks of bread-crumb, slightly hollowed, ornamented
according to taste (<i>i.e.</i>, indented by means of the point of a
small knife) and fried in clarified butter. Their shape is oval
for poached eggs, and round for soft-boiled eggs, the latter
being generally dished upright.</p>

<p>(2) On little, oval <i><a href="#g_feuilletes">feuilletés</a></i> for poached eggs, on <i><a href="#g_feuilletes">feuilletés</a></i>
in the shape of indented crowns, or in small patties for soft-boiled
eggs.</p>

<p>(3) In borders of forcemeat or other preparations, the kind of
which is indicated by the name of the particular egg-preparation.
These borders are laid on the dish by means of a piping-bag
or by hand; they are either oval or round, plain or indented,
poached or oven-browned, according to the nature of
the preparation used.</p>

<p>(4) On tartlet-crusts which are garnished so as to be in keeping
with the method of dressing the eggs.</p>

<p><a id="png.187" href="#png.187"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Remarks.</i>—(1) Poached or soft-boiled eggs, when dished
upon fried rusks, <i><a href="#g_feuilletes">feuilletés</a></i>, or tartlets, should, before being
placed on the latter, be covered with sauce. Also before being
treated with sauce they should be well drained.</p>

<p>(2) Having given the general outlines of the procedure, I
shall now pass on to the particular recipes, stating them briefly,
and reminding the reader that all of them apply equally to
poached and soft-boiled eggs. Thus “Poached Eggs Mireille”
stands for “Poached or Soft-boiled Eggs Mireille.”</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="433—Hard-boiled Eggs"><a id="rcp.433"
 >433—HARD-BOILED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Boiling eggs hard may seem an insignificant matter, but,
like the other modes of procedure, it is, in reality, of some
importance, and should be effected in a given period of time.
If, for a special purpose, they have to be just done, it is pointless
and even harmful to boil them beyond a certain time-limit,
seeing that any excess in the boiling only makes them tough,
and the whites particularly so, owing to their albuminous nature.
In order to boil eggs uniformly, they should be put into a
colander with large holes, whereby they may be plunged at
the same moment of time into the boiling water. From the
time the water regains the boiling point, eight minutes should
be allowed in the case of medium-sized eggs, and ten minutes
in the case of larger ones; but these times should never be
exceeded. As soon as they are done drain the eggs and dip
them in cold water, and then shell them carefully.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="434—Hard-boiled Eggs Carême"><a id="rcp.434"
 >434—HARD-BOILED EGGS CARÊME<!-- TN: original reads "CARÈME" --></a></h3>

<p>Have ready beforehand a timbale crust (No. <a href="#rcp.2394">2394</a>), somewhat
shallow.</p>

<p>For six hard-boiled eggs, slice four artichoke-bottoms of
medium size, and stew them in butter; cut some truffles into
slices, allowing four slices to each egg, and cut up the eggs
<a id="png.191" href="#png.191"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>into discs about one-half inch thick. Prepare also in advance
one-half pint of Nantua sauce.</p>

<p>Garnish the crust with alternate layers of sliced artichoke-bottoms,
egg-discs, and sliced truffles. Finish with a coating
of sauce and a ring of sliced truffles.</p>

<p>Dish up the crust on a napkin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="435—Hard-boiled Eggs Chimay"><a id="rcp.435"
 >435—HARD-BOILED EGGS CHIMAY</a></h3>

<p>Cut the eggs, lengthwise, in two. Remove the yolks, pound
them into a paste, and add thereto an equal quantity of dry
Duxelle (No. <a href="#rcp.223">223</a>). Fill the empty whites with the preparation;
place them on a buttered <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i>-dish; cover them with Mornay
sauce; besprinkle with grated cheese; pour a few drops of
melted butter upon the sauce, and set to glaze in a fierce oven.</p>

<i>anglaise</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.174">174</a>), taking care to cover them well with it,
and then roll them in fine and fresh bread-crumbs, letting this
operation avail for finishing off the shape. Put them into hot
fat seven or eight minutes before dishing up; drain, salt
moderately, place on a napkin, with a centre garnish of very

the rissoles by folding the outside edges of the paste over one
another to look like a closed purse, taking care to press them
well together so as to join them, thus completely enclosing the

<h3 class="recipe" title="440—Eggs en Cocotte"><a id="rcp.440"
 >440—EGGS EN COCOTTE</a></h3>

<p>The poaching of eggs <i><a href="#g_cocotte">en cocotte</a></i> is done in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Cocottes</i> for eggs, which may be replaced by little china or
plaited cases, are a kind of small saucepan in earthenware, in
porcelain, or in silver, provided with a little handle. The time
generally allowed for the cooking or poaching of eggs in this
way is ten minutes, but this time is subject to variations either
way. In order to accelerate the process I should advise the
warming of the <i>cocottes</i> before the insertion of the eggs.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Procedure.</i>—Having garnished the <i>cocottes</i> and
broken the eggs into them, as directed in the recipes given
hereafter, set them in a sauté-pan and pour therein enough
boiling water to reach within one-half inch of the brims of the
<i>cocottes</i>. Place in the oven and cover, just leaving sufficient
opening for the steam to escape.</p>

<p>The eggs are done when the whites are almost set and the
yolks are glossy. After having properly wiped the <i>cocottes</i>,
dish them on a napkin or on a fancy dish-paper.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="441—Eggs en Cocotte au Chambertin"><a id="rcp.441"

grain of salt, and put the <i>cocottes</i>, one by one, into a sauté-pan
containing the necessary quantity of boiling water.</p>

<p>Poach as directed, and set to glaze quickly at the last
moment.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="449—Moulded Eggs"><a id="rcp.449"
 >449—MOULDED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>These form a very ornamental dish, but the time required
to prepare them being comparatively long, poached, soft-boiled,
and other kinds of eggs are generally preferred in their stead.
They are made in variously shaped moulds, ornamented according
to the nature of the preparation, and the eggs are broken
into them direct, or they may be inserted in the form of
scrambled eggs, together with raw eggs poached in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>Whatever be the mode of preparation, the moulds should
always be liberally buttered. The usual time allowed for the
poaching of the eggs in moulds is from ten to twelve minutes,
but when withdrawn from the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> it is well to let the
moulds stand awhile with the view of promoting a settling of
their contents, which action facilitates the ultimate turning out
of the latter.</p>

<p>Empty the moulds on small pieces of toast or tartlets, and
arrange these in a circle round the dish.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="459—Scrambled Eggs"><a id="rcp.459"
 >459—SCRAMBLED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>This dish is undoubtedly the finest of all egg-preparations,
provided the eggs be not over-cooked, and they be kept soft
and creamy.</p>

<p>Scrambled eggs are mostly served in silver timbales, but, in
certain cases, they may also be dished in special little <i><a href="#g_croustade">croustades</a></i>,
in little receptacles made from hollowed brioches, or in tartlet-crusts.
<a id="png.197" href="#png.197"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Formerly, it was customary to garnish scrambled eggs
served in a silver timbale with small, variously-shaped pieces
of toast, or with small scraps of puff-paste, cooked without
colouration, and shaped like crescents, lozenges, rings, <i><a href="#g_palmettes">palmettes</a></i>, &amp;c. This method has something to recommend it, and
may always be adopted. In old cookery, scrambled eggs were
sanctioned only when cooked in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>. This measure
certainly ensured their being properly cooked, but it considerably
lengthened the procedure. The latter may therefore be
shortened by cooking the eggs in the usual way, <i>i.e.</i>, in a
utensil in direct contact with the fire; but in this case the heat
must be moderate, in order that, the process of cooking being
progressive and gradual, perfect homogeneity of the particles
of the eggs (effecting the smoothness of the preparation) may
result.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="460—Method of Scrambling Eggs"><a id="rcp.460"
 >460—METHOD OF SCRAMBLING EGGS</a></h3>

<p>For six eggs, slightly heat one oz. of butter in a thick-bottomed
sauté-pan. Add the six eggs, beaten moderately,
together with a large pinch of salt and a little pepper; place the
pan on a moderate fire, and stir constantly with a wooden
spoon, taking care to avoid anything in the way of sudden,
fierce heat, which, by instantaneously solidifying the egg-molecules,
would cause lumps to form in the mass—a thing
which, above all, should be guarded against.</p>

<p>When, by cooking, the eggs have acquired the proper consistence,
and are still smooth and creamy, take the sauté-pan
off the fire, and finish the preparation by means of one and
one-half oz. of butter (divided into small quantities) and three
tablespoonfuls of cream. Only whisk the eggs to be scrambled
when absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>N.B.—Having given the mode of procedure, which is unalterable
for scrambled eggs, I shall now pass on, in the following
recipes, to the various garnishes suited to this kind of dish.
The quantities I give are those required for six scrambled eggs.</p>

 >482—FRIED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>In the long series of egg-preparations, fried eggs are those
which hold the least important place, for the fried eggs which
are so commonly served at breakfasts in England and America
are really eggs <i>à la <a href="#g_poele_2">poêle</a></i>. The real fried egg is almost unknown
in England and America. As a rule, the garnish given
to this kind of eggs is served apart, while the latter are dished,
either on a napkin or on pieces of toast, with a little fried parsley
laid in the middle of the dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="483—The Preparation of Fried Eggs"><a id="rcp.483"
 >483—THE PREPARATION OF FRIED EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Any fat, provided it be well purified, may be used for these
eggs, but oil is the more customary frying medium. To do
these eggs properly, only one should be dealt with at a time.</p>

<p>Heat some oil in an omelet-pan until it begins to smoke
slightly; break the egg on a plate; season it, and let it slide into
the pan. Then, with a wooden spoon, quickly cover up the
yolk with the solidified portions of the white, in order to keep
the former soft.</p>

<p>Drain the egg on a piece of stretched linen, and proceed
in the same way with the other eggs until the required quantity
has been treated.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="486—Fried Poached Eggs"><a id="rcp.486"

<p>This kind is recommended, because it may be served with

<p>After having properly drained and dried the poached eggs,
which should have been prepared beforehand, dip them carefully
in a Villeroy sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.108">108</a>), and arrange them, one by
one, on a dish. When the sauce has set, pass the point of a
small knife round the eggs to remove any excess of sauce;
take them off the dish to treat them with an <i>anglaise</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.174">174</a>),
and then roll them in very fine, fresh bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Plunge them into very hot fat three or four minutes before

Garnish each half-white of egg with a good tablespoonful of

shaping it in such wise as to represent the other half of the
egg. Dip each whole egg, thus formed, into an <a href="#g_anglaise_3"><i>anglaise</i></a>, and

<h3 class="subhead" title="Omelets">Omelets</h3>

<p>The procedure for omelets is at once very simple and very
difficult, for tastes differ considerably in respect of their preparation.
Some like them well done, others insist upon their
being just done, while there are yet others who only enjoy them
when they are almost liquid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the following conditions apply to all—namely,
that there should be homogeneity of the egg-molecules; that
the whole mass should be smooth and soft; and that it should
be borne in mind that an omelet is in reality scrambled eggs
enclosed in a coat composed of coagulated egg.</p>

<p>I take as my standard an omelet consisting of three eggs,
the seasoning of which comprises a small pinch of table-salt and
a little pepper, and which requires one-half oz. of butter for its
preparation. The quantities of garnishing ingredients given
below, therefore, are based upon this standard.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="492—The Preparation of Omelets"><a id="png.204" href="#png.204"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.492"
 >492—THE PREPARATION OF OMELETS</a></h3>

<p>Heat the butter in the omelet-pan, until it exhales the characteristic
nutty smell. This will not only lend an exquisite
taste to the omelet, but the degree of heat reached in order to
produce the aroma will be found to ensure the perfect setting
of the eggs.</p>

<p>Pour in the beaten and seasoned eggs, and stir briskly with
a fork, in order to heat the whole mass evenly. If the omelet
is to be garnished inside, this ought to be done at the present
stage, and then the omelet should be speedily rolled up and
transferred to a dish, to be finished in accordance with the nature
of its designation.</p>

<p>When the omelet is on the dish, a piece of butter may be
quickly drawn across its surface, to make it glossy.</p>

 >522—OMELET OF LAPWINGS’ EGGS</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as for other omelets, but one ordinary hen’s egg is
generally added to every six lapwings’ eggs in order to give
more body to the preparation. All the omelet recipes already
given may be applied to lapwings’ eggs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="523—Lapwings’ Eggs à la Royale"><a id="rcp.523"

<p>Garnish as many small tartlet moulds as there are eggs with
chicken-forcemeat. Poach, turn out the moulds, and hollow
out the centres of the tartlets in such wise as to be able to set
an egg upright in each.</p>

<p>Place a soft- or hard-boiled egg on each forcemeat tartlet,
coat the eggs with a light purée of mushrooms, besprinkle with
chopped truffles, and arrange in a circle on a dish.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]<br

<p>The preparation of cold eggs is not limited by classical
rules; it rests with the skill and artistic imagination of the
operator, and, since fancifulness and originality are always
closely allied to artistic imagination, it follows that the varieties
evolved may be infinite.</p>

<p>Indeed, so various and numerous are the recipes dealing with
this kind of egg-preparations that I must limit myself to a
selection only of the more customary ones, culled as far as
possible from my own repertory.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="525—Cold Eggs Alexandra"><a id="rcp.525"
 >525—COLD EGGS ALEXANDRA</a></h3>

<p>Take some cold, well-trimmed, poached eggs; dry them and
cover them with a white chaud-froid sauce. Place a fine indented
slice of truffle in the centre of each, and sprinkle with a
cold, white, melted aspic jelly until they are thinly coated therewith.
Slip the point of a small knife round each egg with the
view of moving them more easily, and transfer them to oval
tartlet-crusts made from puff-paste trimmings, baked without
colouration.</p>

<p>Lay a border of caviare round the eggs; dish them in the
form of a crown, and put some chopped jelly in the centre.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="526—Cold Eggs à l’Andalouse"><a id="rcp.526"

<p>Cover some cold, well-dried, poached eggs with a tomato
purée combined with a full third of its volume of Soubise purée
and one-half pint of melted aspic jelly per pint of sauce. Cut
some pimentos, <a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a> in oil, into very thin strips, and lay
these, after the manner of a lattice, upon each egg.</p>

<p>Now garnish as many oiled, oval tartlet-moulds as there
are eggs with tomato purée, thickened with jelly, and let the
garnish set on ice. Turn out the moulds, and put an egg upon
each of the tomato tartlets; arrange the latter in a circle on a
dish surrounded with a chain composed of linked rings of onion,
and garnish the centre with chopped, white jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="527—Cold Eggs Argenteuil"><a id="rcp.527"

cool or on ice for that purpose.</p>

<p>Garnish the centre of a round dish with a small pyramid of
cold, truffled <a href="#g_brandade">Brandade</a> of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>, and set the eggs round the
latter.</p>

black truffle, and surround the base of the eggs with a narrow
ribbon composed of chopped truffles. Glaze with jelly, and
leave to set on ice.</p>

<p>Prepare a salad of green vegetables (peas, French beans cut
into dice or lozenges, asparagus-tops); thicken it with a very
little mayonnaise mixed with melted jelly. Pour this preparation
into an oiled mould, and leave it to set. For dishing,
turn out the salad in the middle of a dish; surround the base
with a line of chopped jelly; encircle the whole with the eggs,
letting them rest on the jelly, and garnish the dish with a
border of dice cut in very clear, white jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="534—Cold Eggs Moscovite"><a id="rcp.534"
 >534—COLD EGGS MOSCOVITE</a></h3>

<p>Slightly level both ends of some shelled, hard-boiled eggs.
Surround the tops and the bases with three little anchovy fillets,
and place a bit of truffle just half-way along each egg. Eggs
prepared in this way resemble little barrels, whereof the anchovy
fillets imitate the iron hoops, and the bits of truffle the bungs.
By means of a tubular cutter empty the eggs with care; garnish
them with caviare, and shape the latter to a point, outside the
edges of the egg.</p>

<p>Lay each egg in an artichoke-bottom, cooked white, and garnished

<h2 class="chap" title="Chapter XIII: Soups"><a id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XIII<br
 ><small>SOUPS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">Soups</span> are divided into two leading classes, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span></p>

<p>1. Clear soups, which include plain and garnished consommés.</p>

<p>2. Thick soups, which comprise the Purées, Veloutés, and
Creams.</p>

<p>A third class, which is independent of either of the above,
inasmuch as it forms part of plain, household cookery, embraces
vegetable soups and Garbures or <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratined</a></i> soups. But
in important dinners—by this I mean rich dinners—only the
first two classes are recognised.</p>

<p>When a menu contains two soups, one must be clear and
the other thick. If only one is to be served, it may be either
clear or thick, in which case the two kinds are represented
alternately at different meals.</p>

<p>In Part I. of this work I indicated the general mode of procedure
for consommés and thick soups; I explained how the
latter might be converted from plain purées into veloutés or
creams, or from veloutés into creams; and all that now remains
is to reveal the recipes proper to each of those soups.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—In the course of the recipes for consommés, given
hereafter, the use of Royales (Nos. <a href="#rcp.206">206</a> to <a href="#rcp.213">213</a>) and of Quenelles,
variously prepared (Nos. <a href="#rcp.193">193</a> to <a href="#rcp.195">195</a> and <a href="#rcp.205">205</a>), will often be
enjoined. For the preparation of these garnishes, therefore, the
reader will have to refer to the numbers indicated.</p>

<p>The quantities for the clear soups that follow are all calculated
to be sufficient for a standard number of six people, and
the quantity of Royales is always given in so many <i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>,
which contain about one-eighth pint, or <a href="#g_baba"><i>baba-moulds</i></a>,
which hold about one-fifth pint.</p>

<p>Of course, it will be understood that the poaching need not
necessarily have been effected in these moulds, for very small
“Charlotte” moulds would do quite as well. But I had recourse
to the particular utensils mentioned above, in order that
<a id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there might be no sort of doubt as to the exact quantity of royale
it would be necessary to prepare for any one of the soups.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Clear Soups and Garnished Consommés">Clear Soups and Garnished Consommés</h3>

<h3 class="recipe" title="591—Consommé aux Nids d’Hirondelles"><a id="rcp.591"
 >591—CONSOMMÉ AUX NIDS D’HIRONDELLES</a></h3>

<p>The nests used for this soup are those of the esculent swallow,
and their shape somewhat resembles that of the rind of a
quartered, dry orange.</p>

<p>In the first place, prepare a chicken consommé containing a
large proportion of nutritious principles. Set three nests to
soak in cold water for twenty-four hours, the object being to
swell the mucilaginous elements of which they are composed
and to make them transparent.</p>

<p>When they have soaked sufficiently remove any pieces of
feather which may have remained in them, using for this
<a id="png.231" href="#png.231"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>purpose the point of a needle, and, when the nests are quite clean,
drain them and put them into the consommé. At this stage
set the consommé to boil, gently, for thirty or thirty-five
minutes without interruption. During this time the gummy
portions of the nests will melt into the consommé, giving the
latter its characteristic viscidity, and there will only remain
visible those portions which, in the natural state, constitute the
framework of the nests; that is to say, little threads not unlike
superfine transparent vermicelli.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="596—Ox-tail Soup"><a id="rcp.596"
 >596—OX-TAIL SOUP</a></h3>

<p><i>For Ten People.</i>—Garnish the bottom of a small stock-pot
or stewpan with one fine carrot and two medium-sized onions
cut into roundels and browned in butter, and one faggot. Add
two small ox-tails, or one of medium size weighing about four lbs. (The tails should be cut into sections, each of which
should contain one of the caudal vertebræ, and they should
then be browned in the oven.) Also add two lbs. of gelatinous
bones, broken very small and likewise browned in the oven.</p>

<p>Now proceed exactly as for brown veal stock (<a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>), taking
note that the whole moistening must consist of no more than
two and one-half quarts of ordinary broth and one quart of
water.</p>

<p>Set to boil very gently for four and one-half or five hours.
This done, strain the broth, which should be reduced to two and
one-half quarts, and completely remove its grease. Transfer
the largest sections of the tails, by means of a braiding-needle,
one by one to another saucepan. Cover them with broth, and
keep them warm for the garnish.</p>

<p>Finely chop one lb. of very lean beef; put this mince into a
saucepan with the white of a leek cut into dice and half the
white of an egg, and mix thoroughly. Add the broth, the
grease of which has been removed, set to boil, stirring constantly
the while, and then leave to simmer for one hour, which
is the time required for the beef to exude all its juices and for
the clarification of the broth.</p>

<p>While the clarification is in progress cut a small carrot in
<i><a href="#g_brunoise">brunoise fashion</a></i>, or turn it by means of a very small spoon.
Cook this garnish in a little water with butter, salt, and sugar.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving strain the ox-tail broth
through a napkin, put the sections of ox-tail and <i>brunoise</i> into
the soup-tureen, and pour thereon the prepared broth. This
soup may be flavoured with port or sherry, but this is optional.</p>

<p>N.B.—If a thickened ox-tail soup be required add to the
broth per every quart of it one-third of an oz. of arrowroot
diluted with a little of the broth or some cold water.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="614—Turtle Soup"><a id="rcp.614"
 >614—TURTLE SOUP</a></h3>

<p>With the exception of a few leading London restaurants,
where a large quantity of this preparation is constantly in
demand, turtle soup is very rarely prepared in the kitchens of
catering establishments. It is more generally obtained ready-made,
either fresh or preserved, and as a rule of exceptional
quality, from firms whose speciality it is to make it, and who
deliver it in excellent condition.</p>

<p>From among the London firms who have deservedly earned
<a id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a reputation for this soup, “Pécriaux” may be quoted as one
whose produce is quite irreproachable.</p>

<p>When a comparatively small quantity of this soup is required,
it is best to buy it ready-made; in the event of its
being desirable to prepare it oneself, the following recipe will
be found the simplest and most practical for the purpose.</p>


<h4 class="subhead" title="Particulars of the Operation">Particulars of the Operation</h4>

<p><i>The Slaughtering of the Turtle.</i>—For soup, take a turtle
weighing from 120 to 180 lbs., and let it be very fleshy and full
of life.</p>

<p>To slaughter it, lay it on its back on a table, with its head
hanging over the side. By means of a double butcher’s hook,
one spike of which is thrust into the turtle’s lower jaw, while
the other suspends an adequately heavy weight, make the animal
hold its head back; then, with all possible dispatch, sever the
head from the body.</p>

<p>Now immediately hang the body over a receptacle, that the
blood may be collected, and leave it thus for one and one-half
or two hours.</p>

<p>Then follows the <span class="nw">dismemberment:—</span>To begin with, thrust
a strong knife between the carapace or upper shell and the
plastron or lower shell, exactly where the two meet, and separate
the one from the other. The turtle being on its back, cut all the
adhering flesh from the plastron, and put the latter aside.
Now cut off the flippers; remove the intestines, which throw
away, and carefully collect all the green fat. Whereupon cut
away the flesh adhering to the carapace; once more remove all
fat, and keep both in reserve.</p>

<p><i>The Treatment of the Carapace, the Plastron, and the
Flippers.</i>—The carapace and plastron, which are the outside
bony framework of the turtle, constitute the only portions wherefrom
the gelatinous flesh, used as the garnish of the soup, are
obtained.</p>

<p>Saw the carapace into six or eight pieces, and the plastron
into four.</p>

<p>Put these pieces with the flippers into boiling water or into
steam, to <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a></i>. Withdraw the flippers as soon as they are
sufficiently stiff for their skin to be removed, and leave the
pieces of carapace and plastron to <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a></i> for five minutes, in
order that they may admit of being scraped. Now cool the
pieces of carapace and plastron and the flippers, and put them
into a stewpan containing enough water to abundantly cover
<a id="png.239" href="#png.239"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them. Set to boil; garnish with vegetables, as in the case of
an ordinary broth, and add a small quantity of turtle herbs.</p>

<p>Five or six hours should be allowed for the cooking of the
carapace and the plastron, but the flippers, which are put to
further uses in other culinary preparations, should be withdrawn
at the end of five hours.</p>

<p>When the pieces are taken from the cooking-liquor, remove
all the flesh from the bones, and cool the former; then trim it
carefully, and cut it into little squares of one and one-half
inches side. It is these squares together with the green fat
(poached in salted water and sliced) which constitute the garnish
of the soup.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of Turtle Soup.</i>—There are two modes of
procedure, though their respective results are almost identical.</p>

<p>1. Make a broth of the flesh of turtle alone, and then add a
very gelatinous beef consommé to it, in pursuance of the
method employed when the turtle soup is bought ready-made.</p>

<p>This procedure is practically the best, more particularly if
the soup has to be kept some time.</p>

<p>2. Make an ordinary broth of shin of beef, using the same
quantity of the latter as of turtle. Also include half a calf’s
foot and one-half lb. of calf’s shin per 3 lbs. of the beef. Add
the flesh of the turtle, or, in the event of its being thought
necessary to clarify, which operation I do not in the least advise,
reserve it for that purpose.</p>

<p>The condiments and aromatics being the same for both
methods, I shall now describe the procedure for method No. 1.</p>

<p><i>The Ingredients of the Soup.</i>—Put into a stewpan of convenient
size the flesh of the turtle and its head and bones.
Moisten partly with the cooking-liquor of the carapace, and
complete the moistening, in the case of a turtle weighing
120 lbs., with enough water to bring the whole to 50 quarts.
By this means a soup of about thirty to thirty-five quarts will
be obtained at the end of the operation. Add salt in the
proportion of one oz. per every five quarts; set to boil; skim,
and garnish with twelve carrots, a bunch of leeks (about ten
bound with a head of celery), one lb. of parsley stalks, eight
onions with ten cloves stuck into them, two lbs. of shallots, and
one head of garlic. Set to boil gently for eight hours. An
hour before straining the soup, add to the garnish four strips
of lemon-peel, a bunch of herbs for turtle, comprising sweet
basil, sweet marjoram, sage, rosemary, savory, and thyme, and
a bag containing four oz. of coriander and two oz. of peppercorns.</p>

<p><a id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Finally, strain the soup through a napkin; add the pieces
of flesh from the carapace and plastron which were put aside
for the garnish, and keep it until wanted in specially-made
sandstone jars.</p>

<p><i>The Serving of the Soup.</i>—When about to serve this soup,
heat it; test and rectify its seasoning, and finish it off by means
of a port wine glass of very old Madeira to every quart.</p>

<p>Very often a milk punch is served with turtle soup, the
recipe <span class="nw">being:—</span></p>

<p><i>Milk Punch.</i>—Prepare a syrup from one-half pint of water
and three and one-half oz. of sugar, the consistence at the
boil being 170° (Baumé’s Hydrometer). Set to infuse in this
syrup two orange and two lemon <i><a href="#g_zest">zests</a></i>. Strain at the end of
ten minutes, and add one-half pint of rum, one-fifth pint of
kirsch, two-thirds pint of milk, and the juice of three oranges
and three lemons. Mix thoroughly. Let it stand for three
hours; filter, and serve cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="615—Consommé Tosca"><a id="rcp.615"
 >615—CONSOMMÉ TOSCA</a></h3>

<p>Have ready one quart of chicken consommé thickened with

<p><i>Remarks Relative to the Consommés.</i>—I gave the recipes
of these consommés in Part I. of this work (<a href="#rcp.6">No. 6</a>), and shall
now, therefore, limit myself to the following remarks, which are
of paramount <span class="nw">importance:—</span></p>

<p>1. These consommés must be perfect in limpidness and
quality.</p>

<p>2. The flavour which typifies them should be at once decided
and yet not too pronounced.</p>

<p>3. When the flavour is imparted by a wine, the latter should
be of the best possible quality. Rather than make use of inferior
wines, the presence of which in the soup would tend to
depreciate its quality, completely discard wine flavourings.</p>

<p>4. Supper consommés never contain any garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="618—Consommé à l’Essence de Cailles"><a id="rcp.618"
 >618—CONSOMMÉ <span class="nw">A L’ESSENCE</span> DE CAILLES</a></h3>

<h3 title="Thick Soups">THICK SOUPS</h3>

<p>In Part I., <a href="#png.019">Chapter I.</a>, of this work I pointed out what thick
soups consist of. I likewise touched upon the general rules
which should be observed in the preparation of each class of
these soups, and showed how most of them could, if necessary,
be converted into and served as cullises, purées, bisques,
veloutés, or creams. The principles governing these alterations
are very simple, and after a moment’s reflection the
operator will thoroughly grasp their import. Be this as it
may, the reader will find the necessary directions at the end
of each recipe that admits of various methods of preparation.</p>

<p>With regard to those recipes which are not followed by any
directions of the sort referred to, and which I simply class
under the name of Potages, these are unalterable preparations
which may only be served in accordance with the directions
given. This being clear, the reader will understand that I
have refrained from repeating the quantities of butter, cream,
thickening ingredients, &amp;c., in each recipe. These particulars
having been given in Part I., it will be necessary to refer to
that part of the book for them.</p>

<a id="png.247" href="#png.247"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>complete the cooking. Meantime, cook two medium-sized,
peeled and quartered potatoes in some consommé.</p>

<p>Now put the turnips and the potato into the same stewpan;
crush them, and rub them through tammy. Bring the purée
to the proper consistence by means of boiled milk, and finish it
in the usual way.</p>

<p>Garnish with some small bread dice fried in butter.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>

 >642—PURÉE D’OSEILLE ET DE VERMICELLE <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span></a></h3>

<p>Sprinkle three oz. of well-separated vermicelli into one pint
of boiling milk or white consommé (according as to whether
the preparation be a Lenten one or not). Let the vermicelli
poach gently for twenty-five minutes, and then add four tablespoonfuls
of sorrel cooked in butter.</p>

<p>Rub the whole through tammy; finish the purée with sufficient
milk or thin cream; heat until the boil is reached, and,
when about to serve, complete by means of a leason composed
of the yolks of two eggs and one-quarter pint of very
fresh cream.</p>

<p>For the garnish, refer to the remarks under No. <a href="#rcp.646">646</a>.</p>

 >643—PURÉE D’OSEILLE ET DE SAGOU <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span></a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as directed in the preceding recipe; but
instead of vermicelli use three oz. of sago. Allow the usual
time for cooking, and add the same quantity of sorrel cooked in
butter.</p>

<p>Use the same quantities of milk or consommé in order to
bring the purée to the proper consistence, and make use of a
precisely similar leason.</p>

 >644—PURÉE D’OSEILLE ET DE SEMOULE <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span></a></h3>

<p>The same as the above, but use three oz. of semolina. All
other particulars remain the same.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="645—Purée d’Oseille et de Tapioca à la Crème"><a id="rcp.645"
 >645—PURÉE D’OSEILLE ET DE TAPIOCA <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span></a></h3>

<p>Procedure like that of No. <a href="#rcp.642">642</a>, using instead of the

<h3 class="recipe" title="646—Remarks relative to the Possible Variations of the Four Preceding Recipes"><a id="rcp.646"
 >646—REMARKS RELATIVE TO THE POSSIBLE VARIATIONS OF THE FOUR PRECEDING RECIPES</a></h3>

<p>A large variety of this kind of soups may be prepared by
using the quantity prescribed of salep, buckwheat, oatmeal,
barley-meal, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>These soups derive a particular and agreeable flavour from
their cohering element.</p>

<p>The chief point to be remembered in their preparation is
their consistence, which should be that of a thin cream.</p>

<p>When too thick, these soups are pasty and disagreeable;
when too thin, they are insipid; hence the desirability of aiming
at a happy medium.</p>

<p>Their garnish is exceedingly variable, the more preferable
forms being small bread dice fried in clarified butter, pressed;
peeled tomatoes cut into dice and tossed in butter; small <a href="#g_printanier"><i>printaniers</i></a>,
<i><a href="#g_brunoise">brunoises</a></i>, <i><a href="#g_julienne">juliennes</a></i>, <i><a href="#g_paysanne">paysannes</a></i>, or well-poached rice.</p>

<p>Thus, from the typical recipe of these soups, a whole series
may be prepared, which need not be gone into separately here.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="647—Purée de Pois aux Croûtons"><a id="rcp.647"
 >647—PURÉE DE POIS AUX CROÛTONS</a></h3>

<p>Wash three-quarters of a pint of split peas in cold water and
put them into a stewpan with one quart of cold water, a little
salt, and one-half lb. of raw ham. Set to boil, skim, and add
two oz. of <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, the minced green leaves of three leeks, a
fragment of thyme and bay, salt, and one-half oz. of sugar. Set
to cook very gently.</p>

<p>Rub through tammy, bring the purée to the proper consistence
by means of white consommé, despumate it sufficiently,
and add butter to it when dishing up.</p>

<p>Garnish with two tablespoonfuls of small bread dice fried
in butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="648—Purée de Pois Frais, Otherwise Saint-Germain"><a id="rcp.648"
 >648—PURÉE DE POIS FRAIS, <span class="nw">otherwise SAINT-GERMAIN</span></a></h3>

<p>The two following methods may be employed, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Cook quickly one and one-quarter pints of fresh peas,
just shelled, in boiling, salted water. Drain them, pound them
in a mortar, moisten the purée with one pint of white consommé,
and rub it through tammy. Bring it to the proper
degree of heat, and add butter when about to serve. Prepared
in this way, the purée should be of a perfect shade.</p>

<p>(2) Stew one and one-quarter pints of fresh peas in one and
one-half oz. of butter, a little lettuce <i><a href="#g_chiffonade">chiffonade</a></i>, one and
one-half oz. of the green part of leeks, a pinch of chervil, a
little salt and sugar, and one-seventh pint of water.</p>

<p>Pound the peas as soon as they are cooked, moisten the
purée with one pint of white consommé, and rub through
tammy. Bring the preparation to the proper degree of heat
and add butter at the last moment.</p>

<p><a id="png.249" href="#png.249"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Treated thus, the purée will be of a fainter shade than the
preceding one, but its flavour will be more delicate.</p>

<p>Garnish, in both cases, with one and one-half tablespoonfuls
of very green, fine peas, and some chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a>. This soup
may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="649—Purée de Pois Frais à la Menthe"><a id="rcp.649"
 >649—PURÉE DE POIS FRAIS <span class="nw">A LA MENTHE</span></a></h3>

<p>Make the purée according to one of the above-mentioned
methods, and add to the peas, while cooking, a faggot consisting
of three little sprigs of fresh mint. Finish with consommé,
and add butter in the usual way.</p>

<p>Garnish with nice peas, as above, and some very tender
mint-leaves, chopped, instead of the chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Remarks Relative to those Soups which have a Purée of
Peas for Base.</i>—A large number of soups may be made from
purées of fresh peas; among others I may mention the following,

“potage au tapioca.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="654—Potage Longchamps"><a id="rcp.654"
 >654—POTAGE LONGCHAMPS</a></h3>

<p>This is the “potage Fontange,” kept somewhat clear, and
with a garnish composed of one and one-half oz. of vermicelli,
poached in consommé, and a pinch of chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a> per quart
of the soup.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="655—Potage Marigny"><a id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum"><span

<h3 class="recipe" title="656—Potage Marcilly"><a id="rcp.656"
 >656—POTAGE MARCILLY</a></h3>

<p>Half of this consists of a purée of peas and the other half
of a purée of chicken. Prepare these purées in the usual way
and mix them together when about to serve.</p>

<p>Garnish with two tablespoonfuls of Japanese pearls poached

in the shape of pearls, per quart of the soup.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="657—Potage Saint-Marceau"><a id="rcp.657"
 >657—POTAGE SAINT-MARCEAU</a></h3>

<p>This is an ordinary purée of peas with butter, combined with
two tablespoonfuls of a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> consisting of the white of a
leek and some chervil <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a> per quart of the purée.
This list could be considerably lengthened, but what there is
of it amply suffices to show the great number of soups that
may be obtained from the combination of other suitable products
with the purée of peas and the modification of the garnish
in each case.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="658—Purée de Pommes de Terre, otherwise Parmentier"><a id="rcp.658"
 >658—PURÉE DE POMMES DE TERRE, <span class="nw">otherwise PARMENTIER</span></a></h3>

<p>Finely mince the white of two medium-sized leeks, and fry
them without colouration in one oz. of butter. Add three
medium-sized peeled and quartered potatoes, one pint of white
consommé, and cook quickly. The moment the potatoes seem
soft to the touch crush them and rub them through tammy.</p>

<p>Fry in one oz. of butter a somewhat finely-cut <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>
consisting of one oz. of breast of bacon cut into dice, one-third
of a carrot, half an onion, a fragment of thyme and bay. Add
to this fried <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> eight medium-sized tomatoes, pressed and
cut into pieces the size of a clove of garlic, a pinch of sugar,
two and one-half oz. of rice, and one pint of white consommé.
<a id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Set to cook gently, rub through tammy, and finish with the
necessary quantity of consommé.</p>

<p>When about to serve complete the purée by adding thereto,
away from the fire, two oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Garnish with two tablespoonfuls<!-- TN: original reads "tablesponfuls" --> of poached rice, each grain
being separate, and the same quantity of peeled tomatoes cut
into dice and briskly tossed in butter.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="660—Purée de Tomates au Tapioca, otherwise Waldèze"><a id="rcp.660"
 >660—PURÉE DE TOMATES AU TAPIOCA, <span class="nw">otherwise WALDÈZE</span></a></h3>

<p>Prepare one and one-half pints of tapioca in white consommé,
and keep it a little lighter than ordinary tapioca. Also
press, peel, and cut into dice the pulp of three medium-sized,
very red tomatoes; poach these dice in some consommé and mix
them with the tapioca.</p>

<p>Or, failing fresh tomatoes, add to the tapioca two tablespoonfuls
of concentrated tomato purée diluted in a bowl with
some white consommé.</p>

<p>Send two oz. of grated cheese to the table separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="661—Purée de Topinambour, otherwise Palestine"><a id="rcp.661"
 >661—PURÉE DE TOPINAMBOUR, <span class="nw">otherwise PALESTINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Finely mince two lbs. of Jerusalem artichokes and stew them
in one oz. of butter. Add five torrefied and crushed filberts,
moistened with one pint of white consommé, and set to cook
gently. Rub through tammy; finish the purée with one-quarter
pint of milk, in which one tablespoonful of fecula has been
diluted, cold. Set to boil and add butter when dishing up.</p>

<p>Garnish with small bread dice fried in butter.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="662—Bisque d’Écrevisses"><a id="rcp.662"
 >662—BISQUE D’ÉCREVISSES<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>(1) Cut into very small dice one oz. of carrot, one oz. of
onion, and two parsley stalks. Add a fragment of thyme and
bay; brown this <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> with butter, in a sautépan; throw in
fifteen crayfish for “Bisque” (their average weight being about
one and one-third oz.), and toss them in the <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> until they
acquire a very red colour. Sprinkle with two tablespoonfuls
of burnt brandy and one-quarter pint of white wine, season with
a large pinch of salt and a pinch of ground pepper, and set to
reduce.</p>

<p>This done, moisten with one-quarter pint of white consommé
and leave to cook for ten minutes.</p>

<p><a id="png.252" href="#png.252"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Also cook three oz. of rice in one and one-half pints of
white consommé.</p>

<p>(2) Shell the crayfishes’ tails and put them aside; also reserve
eight carapaces. Drain the crayfishes of all their cooking-liquor;
finely pound them and their remains and the <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>.
Add the rice, properly cooked, and the cooking-liquor of the
crayfish, and rub through a sieve, first, and then through
tammy.</p>

<p>Add to the resulting purée one-half pint of white consommé,
set to boil, wielding a whisk the while, pass through a strainer,
and then keep the preparation in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, taking care to
place a few lumps of butter on its surface lest a skin should
form while the bisque is waiting to be served.</p>

<p>Finish the preparation when dishing up with two and one-half oz. of butter, three tablespoonfuls of excellent thick cream,
and a very little cayenne.</p>

<p>Garnish with the crayfish tails cut into dice, and the eight
carapaces stuffed with a fish forcemeat with cream and poached
seven or eight minutes previously.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="663—Bisque de Homard"><a id="rcp.663"
 >663—BISQUE DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>After substituting for the crayfish a raw lobster weighing
three lbs., cut into small sections, the procedure is the same as
that of No. <a href="#rcp.662">662</a>. It is only necessary, therefore, to refer to that
recipe for all particulars relating to preparation and quantities.</p>

<p>Garnish with the meat taken from the tail; this should have
been kept aside and cut into small dice.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="664—Bisque de Crevettes"><a id="rcp.664"
 >664—BISQUE DE CREVETTES</a></h3>

<p>The mode of procedure for this bisque, the <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, the
thickening ingredients, the moistening, and the finishing of
the soup are identical with those of No. <a href="#rcp.662">662</a>.</p>

<p>All that is needed, therefore, is to substitute for the crayfish
two lbs. of raw shrimps.</p>

<p>Instead of using ordinary butter in finishing this bisque, use
three oz. of shrimp butter. Garnish with twenty-five reserved
tails, these being shelled and trimmed.</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a velouté or a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="665—Coulis de Gibier, otherwise au Chasseur"><a id="rcp.665"

<p>Prepare six oz. of the meat of a wild rabbit, six oz. of that
of a partridge, and six oz. of that of a pheasant. These meats
should be roasted and their roast-cases swilled with a liqueur-glass
<a id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of burnt brandy. The resulting gravy should be added
to the soup.</p>

<p>Now finely pound these meats together with one-half pint of
cooked and drained lentils. When the whole has become a
smooth purée add the cooking-liquor of the lentils and the
swillings referred to above and rub through tammy.</p>

<p>Finish the cullis with the necessary quantity of consommé,
heat it, and pass it through a strainer. Add butter at the last
moment and season moderately.</p>

<p>Garnish with three tablespoonfuls<!-- TN: original reads "tablesponfuls" --> of small, very fresh mushrooms;
these to be finely minced and tossed in butter.</p>

<p>Fry four fine thrushes in butter and complete their cooking
in one pint of feathered game consommé containing five oz. of
rye-bread dice fried in butter. These dice constitute in this
case the thickening element of the soup. Remove and put aside
the thrushes’ fillets, finely pound the carcasses together with two
juniper-berries, add the leason of bread dice, and rub through
tammy.</p>

<p>Add to the resulting purée one-quarter pint of feathered-game
consommé, set to boil, and pass through a strainer.
Finish the cullis with two and one-half oz. of butter and four
tablespoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>Garnish with the reserved fillets cut into thin slices or into

<p>Proceed as in No. <a href="#rcp.666">666</a> in so far as the preparatory details
and the quantities are concerned, but take note of the following
changes in other <span class="nw">directions:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Substitute for the thrushes two grouse or two hazel-hens,
taking care to discard the legs and the carcasses.</p>

<p>(2) Use ordinary bread dice instead of those of rye-bread.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="668—Coulis de Lapereau au Currie"><a id="rcp.668"

<p>Cut the legs of a young wild rabbit into small pieces, stiffen
these in butter, and put them into the stewpan with a few
roundels of carrot and onion, one small faggot of parsley and
celery, and one quart of white consommé. Set to cook gently.</p>

<p>Also lightly brown in butter two tablespoonfuls<!-- TN: original reads "tablesponfuls" --> of chopped
onion, besprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of fecula and a
<a id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>sufficient quantity of curry, moisten with the strained cooking-liquor
of the pieces of rabbit, bring to the boil, and set to simmer
for seven or eight minutes. Rub through tammy and then
despumate for twenty minutes, adding from time to time one or
two tablespoonfuls of consommé with the view of promoting the
clarification of the cullis. When about to serve finish the latter
with three or four tablespoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>Garnish with eighteen very small slices taken from the pieces
of rabbit and two oz. of rice à l’Indienne, serving the latter
separately.</p>

<p>Split the shells of fifteen fine chestnuts, put them in a stewpan
with water, boil them for five minutes, and shell and peel
them quickly while they are still very hot. Then cook them
gently in one-half pint of white consommé with one-third of a
stick of celery, minced, and one piece of loaf-sugar.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poële</a><!-- TN: original reads "Poêle" --></i> a partridge, remove the fillets for the purpose of garnish,
bone the rest, and pound it finely together with the carcass
and the <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a><!-- TN: original reads "poêling" --></i> liquor. Add the chestnuts, pound the
whole, and add some consommé to the resulting purée with
the object of facilitating the rubbing through tammy. This
done, add to the preparation about one-quarter pint of very
clear game stock, bring the whole to the boil, pass it through a
strainer, and finish the cullis, when dishing up, with a very
little cayenne and one and one-half oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Garnish with the fillets of partridge cut into a small

<p>Poach in one quart of white consommé a cleaned fowl weighing
about three lbs. and two oz. of rice previously <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>.
Having cooked the fowl, withdraw it, raise its fillets, and put
them aside. Bone the remainder and finely pound the meat.
When the latter is a smooth paste mix therewith the rice, which
should be very well cooked, add the necessary amount of white
consommé to the purée, and rub through tammy. Bring the
cullis to the boil and pass it through a fine strainer.</p>

<p>Finish the preparation, when dishing up, with a leason composed
of the yolks of three eggs, one-sixth pint of cream, and
three oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Garnish with the reserved fillets cut into small, regular dice.</p>

<p>(1) Prepare one and one-half pints of poultry velouté, keeping
it somewhat thin.</p>

<p>(2) Clean, wash, peel, and quickly pound eight oz. of very
fresh mushrooms, newly gathered if possible.</p>

<p>Rub through a fine sieve, and add the resulting purée of
raw mushrooms to the velouté. Bring the whole to the boil once
or twice, and this done rub through tammy immediately.
Finish with the leason and add butter when dishing up.</p>

<p>Garnish with one tablespoonful of a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of raw mushrooms
tossed in butter, one tablespoonful of chicken fillets, and
as much salted tongue, both of which should also be cut in
<i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne-fashion</a></i>.</p>

<p>N.B.—With regard to veloutés I remind the reader that the
velouté of ordinary consistence represents one-half of the soup,
the purée typifying the latter represents one-quarter, while the
consommé required to bring the soup to the correct degree of
consistence should be in the proportion of the remaining
quarter.</p>

<p>The leason, per quart of the soup, should consist of the yolks
of three eggs and one-sixth pint of cream, while the average
quantity of butter should measure about two and one-half oz.
(see No. <a href="#rcp.242">242</a>).</p>

<p>This soup may also be prepared as a cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="672—Velouté de Blanchaille au Currie"><a id="rcp.672"

<p>Bear in mind that this soup ought to be made and served
within the space of twenty minutes, for if it be left to stand for
however short a time, it will most probably turn, in spite of
every possible precaution.</p>

<p>Cook three oz. of finely chopped onion in butter without
colouration, besprinkle with one-half coffeespoonful of curry,
moisten with one and one-half pints of boiling water, add
a faggot, a pinch of salt, a few sprigs of saffron (or a little of

<h3 class="recipe" title="680—Velouté d’Éperlans"><a id="rcp.680"
 >680—VELOUTÉ<!-- TN: acute invisible --> D’ÉPERLANS</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a thin panada with one pint of boiled milk and two
and one-half oz. of crumbled bread. Season with a pinch of
salt and a very small quantity of mignonette. Also stew
gently, in one oz. of butter, two tablespoonfuls of chopped
onion, two and one-half oz. of fillets of smelt, one-half lb. of
fillets of sole, or the meat of a dory, and the juice of the quarter
of a lemon.</p>

<p><a id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Add the fish, stewed in butter and pounded, to the panada,
together with one-half pint of ordinary thin velouté.</p>

<p>Rub through tammy; heat; season with a very little cayenne,
and finish the whole, when dishing up, with an ordinary leason
and one and one-half oz. of butter.</p>

<p>N.B.—1. In view of the decided flavour of the smelt, and
the really disagreeable taste it imparts to a preparation which
contains overmuch of it, its flesh should never exceed the proportion
of one-third of the required quantity of fish. The remaining
two-thirds should be supplied by a fish of neutral
flavour, such as the sole or dory, both of which are admirably
suited to this purpose.</p>

<p>2. The velouté d’éperlans should, like almost all fish
veloutés, be prepared as quickly as possible, and at the last
moment. The process should not last longer than thirty
minutes, for, if there be any delay, the preparation will turn
and lose its flavour.</p>

<p>3. For this soup I elected to use a panada as the thickening
element, instead of a fish velouté, the reason being that, were
the latter used, the taste of fish would in the end be too pronounced.</p>

<p>Garnish with lobster meat in dice, one tablespoonful of
pimentos in dice, and two tablespoonfuls of pilaff rice, to which
add a very little saffron.</p>

<p><i>Remarks relating to the Variation of these Veloutés.</i>—By
merely substituting an equivalent quantity of crayfish, shrimps,
or crabs, for the lobster, the recipes dealing with veloutés of
lobster, given above, may be applied to <i>Veloutés of Crayfish</i>,
<i>Shrimps</i>, or <i>Crabs</i>.</p>

<p>It would therefore be pointless to repeat them, since all that
is needed is to read crayfish, shrimps, or crabs wherever the
word lobster appears.</p>

<p>Thus I shall only point out that the number of these
veloutés may be increased at will, the only requisites being the
change of the basic ingredient and the modification of the
garnish.</p>

 >695a—COLD CHICKEN VELOUTÉ FOR SUPPERS</a></h3>

<p>The preparation of these veloutés requires the utmost care,
but, as a rule, they are very much liked.</p>

<p>Prepare a white roux from one oz. of butter and one and
one-sixth oz. of flour per quart of the moistening. Dilute with
some very strong clear consommé, thoroughly cleared of
grease; boil, and despumate for one and one-half hours, adding
meanwhile half as much consommé as served in the moistening
of the velouté.</p>

<p>When the velouté is thoroughly despumated and entirely
cleared of grease, strain it through a silk sieve, and add, per
quart, one-quarter pint of very fresh thin cream. Cool, stirring
incessantly the while; once more strain the velouté through the
sieve when it is cold, and, if necessary, add some of the
consommé already used, in order to give the velouté the consistence
of a thickened consommé. Serve it in cups, and see
that it be sufficiently thin to not impaste the mouth of the
consumer.</p>

<p>This velouté is usually served as it stands, but it allows of
various condimentary adjuncts. Such <span class="nw">are:—</span>Tomato and capsicum
essences; crayfish, shrimp, or game creams. These
creams or essences should be of consummate delicacy, and
ought to lend only a very delicate flavour to the velouté.</p>

<p><i>Remarks relative to Creams.</i>—I remind the reader here
that (1) the thickening element of creams is a Béchamel prepared
in the usual way (see No. <a href="#rcp.28">28</a>); (2) in the preparation of a cream,
of what kind soever, the Béchamel should constitute half of
the whole, the basic ingredient a quarter, and the white consommé

<p><a id="png.270" href="#png.270"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Remarks concerning the Possible Variation of this Soup.</i>—The
mode of procedure adopted in the case of the Germiny
could, if necessary, be applied to all thick soups, and it would
then constitute a class to which the term “Cream” would be
better suited than it is at present to the soups thus designated.</p>

<p>Instead of the ordinary white consommé, which is used in
its preparation, a consommé may be used in which such vegetables
as carrots, turnips, peas, &amp;c., are cooked, the latter
being reserved for the garnish, while the cooking-liquor is
thickened with egg-yolks and cream in accordance with the
quantities and directions given in the above recipe.</p>

<p>A carrot cream, a cream of fresh peas, or of asparagus-heads,
prepared in this way, would be much more delicate than those
prepared after the ordinary recipes.</p>

<p>The essential point in this series of soups is the leason; this
should consist of enough egg-yolks to render the preparations
sufficiently thick and creamy.</p>

<p>Cut the necks into three, the gizzards into four, and the
pinions into two. Brown one-half lb. of these giblets in a
thick-bottomed stewpan with one oz. of butter. Sprinkle with
one tablespoonful of flour; slightly colour the latter, and moisten
with one quart of white consommé and one pint of water. Add
a faggot containing one stick of celery, and set to cook gently
for three hours.</p>

<p>When the pieces of giblets are cooked, drain them, trim
them, and put them into a stewpan with one dessertspoonful of
parboiled rice and a heaped tablespoonful of the white of celery,
minced and fried in butter. Strain the cooking-liquor of the
giblets, through a strainer, over the enumerated garnishes;
set to cook gently for another quarter of an hour; season
strongly with pepper, and serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="742—Soupe Aux Cerises"><a id="rcp.742"
 >742—SOUPE AUX CERISES</a></h3>

<p>Stone two-thirds lb. of small, fleshy cherries, and put twenty
aside for garnishing purposes. Put the others into a sugar-boiler
with two-thirds pint of hot water, a small strip of lemon
rind, and a fragment of cinnamon, and set to boil quickly for
eight minutes.</p>

<p>Also boil in another sugar-boiler one-half pint of Port or
Bordeaux wine. Crush half of the cherry-stones in the mortar;
put them into the boiled wine, and let them infuse, away from
the fire.</p>

<p>Rub the cooked cherries through a fine sieve; dilute the
purée with the juice thickened by means of one tablespoonful
of fecula moistened with cold water; add the cherries put aside
for the garnish, and one-half tablespoonful of castor sugar, and
again set to boil for four minutes.</p>

<p>Complete the preparation with the infusion strained through
muslin; pour it into the soup-tureen, and add a few <a href="#g_biscottes"><i>biscottes</i></a>.</p>

<p>For the sake of variety, lady’s-finger biscuits may be substituted

<p>Cut a small fowl, or half a medium-sized one, into little
pieces, and put these in a stewpan with a few roundels of carrot
and onion, a small bunch of parsley and celery, one-half oz. of
mushroom parings and one quart of white consommé. Set to
boil, and then let cook gently.</p>

<p>Also lightly brown in butter half a medium-sized onion,
chopped; besprinkle it with one dessertspoonful of fecula and
one coffeespoonful of curry; moisten with the cooking-liquor of
the fowl, strained through a sieve; boil, and set to cook
gently for seven or eight minutes. Now rub the whole through
tammy, and leave it to despumate for twenty minutes, adding
one tablespoonful of consommé, from time to time, with the
view of promoting the despumation, <i>i.e.</i>, the purification of the
soup.</p>

<p>When about to serve, finish the preparation with three or
four tablespoonfuls of cream. Pour the whole into the soup-tureen;
add a portion of the meat of the fowl, cut into thin

<h3 class="recipe" title="749—Soupe aux Gombos ou Okra"><a id="rcp.749"
 >749—SOUPE AUX GOMBOS OU OKRA</a></h3>

<p>This soup is held in high esteem by Americans. It is
served either with garnish, as I direct below, or as a consommé,
hot or cold, or in cups, after it has been strained.</p>

<p>Fry one medium-sized chopped onion in two oz. of butter,
without letting it acquire any colour. Add one-quarter lb. of
fresh lean bacon, or raw ham cut into medium-sized dice; fry
for a few minutes, and add about one lb. of boned chicken-meat
cut into large dice (the white parts of the chicken are
used in preference); let these ingredients stiffen well; take care
to stir fairly often, and moisten with two quarts of white chicken
consommé. Boil, and set to cook gently for twenty or twenty-five
minutes with lid on.</p>

<p><a id="png.277" href="#png.277"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]<br

<i><a href="#g_paysanne">paysanne-fashion</a></i>, and three or four medium-sized tomatoes,
peeled, <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i>, and with their seeds withdrawn.</p>

<p>When the gombos are well cooked, carefully remove all
grease from the preparation; test the seasoning, and, if necessary,
add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.</p>

<p>Garnish the soup with two or three tablespoonfuls of plainly-cooked
rice.</p>

<p>N.B.—This soup is excellent if it be finished with one-quarter
pint of cream per quart. A cream of gombos may also be prepared,
which may be garnished with the dice of chicken meat.
In the latter case, the garnish of rice is optional.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XIV<br
 ><small>FISH</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">In</span> matters culinary, fish comprise not only the vertebrates
of the sea and river, but also the esculent crustacea, mollusca,
and chelonia, and one batrachian. Of course, the animals
representing these various classes differ enormously in respect
of their importance as articles of diet. Fresh-water fish, for instance,
with the exception of salmon and some kinds of trout,
are scarcely ever eaten in England; and the same applies to
the frog. As regards salt-water fish, although certain species,
such as the sole and the turbot, are in great demand, many
other and excellent ones which are looked upon as inferior are
seldom put into requisition by first-class cookery. Thus, <i>Brill</i>,
<i>Red Mullet</i>, and <i>Bass</i> are not nearly so popular as they deserve
to be, and never appear on a menu of any importance.
No doubt, Fashion—ever illogical and wayward—exercises her
tyrannical sway here, as in other matters of opinion; for it will
be found, even when the distinctions among fish are once
established, that there exist a host of incongruities in the unwritten
law. Fresh cod is a case in point; should this fish
appear on the menu of a grand dinner given by Royalty, the
guests would not think it at all out of place; but if the chef
of a large modern hotel ventured to include it among the items
of a plain table-d’hôte dinner he would most probably incur
the scorn and indignation of his clientèle.</p>

<p>This example, than which none could be better suited to our
case, successfully shows that the culinary value of the fish has
far less to do with the vogue the latter enjoys than the very often
freakish whims of the public.</p>

<p>One can but deplore the arbitrary proscription which so
materially reduces the resources at the disposal of a cook,
more particularly at a time when the universally imperious cry
is for novelty and variety in dishes and menus respectively;
and one can only hope that reason and good sense may, at no
remote period, intervene to check the purposeless demands of
both entertainers and their guests in this respect.</p>

<p><a id="png.279" href="#png.279"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Having regard to these considerations, I have omitted from
this work, which is really a thesaurus of selected recipes and
not a complete formulary, all those fish enumerated below,
which are very rarely eaten in England, and the recipes for

are so well known that it would be almost superfluous to
repeat their recipes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="775—Divers Ways of Cooking Fish"><a id="rcp.775"
 >775—DIVERS WAYS OF COOKING FISH</a></h3>

<p>The divers ways of cooking fish are all derived from one or
another of the following <span class="nw">methods:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Boiling in salted water, which may be applied equally
well to large pieces and slices of fish.</p>

<p>(2) Frying, particularly suited to small specimens and thin
slices of larger ones.</p>

<p>(3) Cooking in butter, otherwise “à la Meunière,” best
suited to the same pieces as <a href="#rcp.2">No. 2</a>.</p>

<p>(4) Poaching, with short moistening, especially suited to
fillets or small specimens.</p>

<p>(5) Braising, used particularly for large pieces.</p>

<p>(6) Grilling, for small specimens and collops.</p>

<p>(7) Cooking au <a href="#g_gratin">Gratin</a>, same as grilling.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="776—The Boiling of Fish in Salted Water"><a id="rcp.776"
 >776—THE BOILING OF FISH IN SALTED WATER</a></h3>

<p>The procedure changes according as to whether the fish is
to be cooked whole or in slices. If whole, after having
<a id="png.281" href="#png.281"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>263<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>properly cleaned, washed, and trimmed it, lay it on the drainer of
the utensil best suited to its shape; <i>i.e.</i>, a fish-kettle. Cover it
with water, salt it in the proportion of one-quarter oz. of salt
per quart of water, cover the utensil, and bring the liquid to
the boil. As soon as this is done skim and move the kettle to
the side of the fire, where the cooking of the fish may be completed
without boiling.</p>

<p>If the fish is cut into slices, plunge these, which should
never be cut too thin, into boiling salted water, and move the
fish-kettle containing them to the side of the fire; complete
their cooking slowly without allowing the water to boil.</p>

<p>The object of this process is to concentrate, inside the fish,
all the juices contained in its flesh, whereof a large portion
escapes when the cut fish is plunged in cold water gradually
brought to the boil. If this method is not applied to large
fish, cooked whole, the reason is that the sudden immersion of
these in boiling water would cause such a shrinking of their
flesh that they would burst and thereby be spoiled.</p>

<p>In the case of certain kinds of fish, such as Turbot and
Brill, milk is added to the water in the proportion of one-eighth
of the latter, the object being to increase the whiteness of the
fish.</p>

<p>For the various kinds of Salmon and Trout, the <i>court-bouillon</i>
(No. <a href="#rcp.163">163</a>) is used in the place of salted water, but the
general working process remains the same.</p>

<p>The boiled fish is dished on a napkin and drainer; it is
garnished with fresh parsley; and the sauce announced on the
menu, together with some plain-boiled and floury potatoes, is
sent to the table separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="777—The Frying of Fish"><a id="rcp.777"
 >777—THE FRYING OF FISH</a></h3>

<p>In Part I. of this work I explained the general theory of
frying (Chapter X., No. <a href="#rcp.262">262</a>); I shall now, therefore, only concern
myself with the details of the operation in its relation to
fish.</p>

<p>As a rule, frying should never be resorted to for very large
fish or very thick slices of the latter, for, owing to the very high
temperature that the operation enjoins, the outside of the fish
would be dried up before the inside had even become affected.</p>

<p>If the fish to be fried is somewhat thick, it is best to cut
several gashes in it, lengthwise and across, these being deeper
and closer together the thicker the fish may be. The object
of this measure is to facilitate the cooking, but the measure
itself is quite unnecessary when dealing with small fish. In
<a id="png.282" href="#png.282"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the case of flat-fish, partly detach the two underlying fillets on
either side of the back-bone instead of gashing them.</p>

<p>All fish intended for frying (except <i>Blanchailles</i> and Whitebait)
should first be steeped in salted milk, then rolled in flour
before being plunged into the hot fat. If they be <a href="#g_anglaise_1">“<i>panés à
l’anglaise</i></a>,” however, as they generally are in England, the
milk may be dispensed with, in which case, after they have
been lightly coated with flour, they are completely dipped in
an <i>anglaise</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.174">174</a>) and afterwards rolled in white bread-crumbs.
They should then be patted with the blade of a knife
so as to ensure the cohesion of the whole coating, and, finally,
the latter should be criss-crossed with the back of a knife with
the view of improving the appearance when fried.</p>

<p>Fried fish are served either on a napkin, on a drainer, or on
special dish-papers. They are garnished with fried parsley and
properly trimmed half-lemons.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="778—The Cooking of Fish à la Meunière"><a id="rcp.778"
 >778—THE COOKING OF FISH <span class="nw">A LA MEUNIÈRE</span></a></h3>

<p>This excellent mode of procedure is only suited to small
fish or the slices of larger ones. Nevertheless, it may be resorted
to for chicken-turbots, provided their weight do not
exceed four lbs.</p>

<p>The operation consists in cooking the fish (or slices or fillets
of fish) in the frying-pan with very hot butter, after having
seasoned them and sprinkled them with flour. If the fish
are very small, ordinary butter is used; if, on the other hand,
they are large, the procedure demands clarified butter. When
the fish is sufficiently coloured on one side, it is turned over for
the completion of the operation. This done, it is transferred,
by means of a spatula, to a hot dish, whereon, after having
been salted, it is sent to the table.</p>

<p>It may be served as it is with a garnish of trimmed half-lemons.</p>

<p>Fish prepared in this way are termed “dorés” (<i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i>),
“Soles dorés,” “Turbotins dorés,” &amp;c., in order to distinguish
them from those prepared à la Meunière.</p>

<p>If the fish is announced “à la Meunière,” a few drops of
lemon should be sprinkled upon it; it should be seasoned with
salt and pepper, and garnished with <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i>, scalded parsley.
At the last moment a piece of butter, in proportion to the
size of the fish, is put in the frying-pan, and is heated until it
begins to brown slightly. This is poured over the fish immediately,
and the latter is sent to the table at once while still
<a id="png.283" href="#png.283"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>covered by the froth resulting from the contact of the butter
with the parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="779—The Poaching of Fish"><a id="rcp.779"
 >779—THE POACHING OF FISH</a></h3>

<p>This method is best suited to sole, chicken-turbots, and brill,
as well as to the fillets of various fish.</p>

<p>Having laid the fish to be poached in a baking-tray or a
sautépan, either of which should have been previously buttered,
season it moderately with salt and moisten with a little
very white fish or mushroom <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>; very often the two latter
are mixed. Cover the utensil, push it into a moderate oven,
and baste from time to time, especially when a large fish is
cooking. When the fish is done, drain it carefully, place it on
a dish, and, as a rule, reduce the poaching-liquor and add it to
the sauce. Poached fish are always served sauced; <i>i.e.</i>,
covered with the sauce which properly forms their accompaniment.
More often than not they are garnished after the
manner which will be described later.</p>

<p>I most emphatically urge: (1) the use of very little fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>
for the poaching, but this <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> should be perfect and should,
above all, not be cooked for longer than the required time;
(2) that the fish be not covered with buttered paper as is often
done, for nowadays a suitable paper is very rarely found. All
papers found on the market are, owing to the chemical products
used in their manufacture, liable to impart a more or less pungent
smell to the objects they enclose, which in either degree
would prove seriously prejudicial to the preparation.</p>

<p>These remarks not only apply to fish, but to all those
objects with which paper was formerly used at some stage in
their cooking process.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="780—The Braising of Fish"><a id="rcp.780"
 >780—THE BRAISING OF FISH</a></h3>

<p>This method is generally applied to whole or sliced salmon,
to trout, and to chicken-turbot. Sometimes the fish treated in
this way is larded on one side with strips of bacon-fat, truffles,
gherkins, or carrots. The mode of procedure is exactly the
same as that described under the “Braising of White Meats”
(No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>). Moisten these braisings in the proportion of one-half
with white wine or red wine (according as to how the fish
is to be served), and for the other half use a light fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.
Place the fish on the drainer of a fish-kettle just large enough
to hold the former, and moisten in such wise that the cooking-liquor
at the beginning of the operation does not cover more
than three-quarters of the depth of the fish. Unless it be for
<a id="png.284" href="#png.284"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a Lenten dish, the fish may be covered with slices of bacon
while cooking. In any case, baste it often. Take care not to
close the lid down too tightly, in order that the liquor may be
reduced simultaneously with the cooking of the fish.</p>

<p>When the operation is almost completed, take the lid off the
fish-kettle with the view of glazing the fish; then take the
former off the fire. Now withdraw the drainer with the fish
upon it, and lay it athwart the top of the fish-kettle, and let it
drain; tilt the fish on to a dish, and cover the latter pending
its despatch to the table. Strain the stock remaining in the
fish-kettle through a strainer; let it stand for ten minutes, remove
all the grease that has formed on its surface, and use it to
complete the sauce as I directed above.</p>

<p>Braised fish are generally accompanied by a garnish, the
constituents of which I shall give in the particular recipes
relating to braising.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="781—The Grilling of Fish"><a id="rcp.781"
 >781—THE GRILLING OF FISH</a></h3>

<p>This method is best suited to small fish, to medium-sized
chicken-turbots, and to large-sectioned fish.</p>

<p>Unless they are very small, it is best to gash both sides of
fish intended for grilling; the reasons given above for this
measure likewise apply here.</p>

<p>All white and naturally dry fish should be rolled in flour
and besprinkled with butter or very good oil before being
placed on the grill to be exposed to the heat of the fire. The
flour forms a crust around the fish, which keeps it from drying
and gives it that golden colour quite peculiar to objects thus
treated.</p>

<p>Salmon, trout, red mullet, mackerel, and herrings, the flesh
whereof is fatty, need not be floured, but only besprinkled with
melted butter.</p>

<p>Owing to the somewhat fragile texture of most fish, a special
double gridiron is used, by means of which they may be turned
without fear of damage. This gridiron is placed upon the
ordinary grill. I have already given in Part I. of this work
the radical principles of grilling (Nos. <a href="#rcp.257">257</a> and <a href="#rcp.260">260</a>); to this,
therefore, the reader is begged to refer.</p>

<p>Grilled fish are served on a very hot dish, without paper or
a napkin; they are garnished with fresh parsley and grooved
slices of lemon.</p>

<p>Butter à la Maître d’Hôtel, anchovy butter, devilled sauce,
Roberts’ sauce Escoffier, and butter à la Ravigote constitute
the best adjuncts to grilled fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="782—The Cooking of Fish au Gratin"><a id="png.285" href="#png.285"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.782"
 >782—THE COOKING OF FISH AU GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>I described all the details of this method under Complete
Gratin (No. <a href="#rcp.269">269</a>), to which I must ask the reader to refer. This
process is best suited to small fish, such as sole, whiting, red
mullet, chicken-turbot, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="783—The Crimping of Fish"><a id="rcp.783"
 >783—THE CRIMPING OF FISH</a></h3>

<p>Crimped fish is quite an English speciality. This method
of preparation is applied more particularly to salmon, fresh
cod, haddock, and skate. The first three of these fish may be
prepared whole or in slices, while skate is always cut into more
or less large pieces after it has been skinned on both sides.</p>

<p>In order to crimp a whole fish, it should be taken as it leaves
the water. Lay it on something flat, and make deep lateral
gashes on both its sides from head to tail. Allow a space of
about one and one-half inches to two inches between each gash.
This done, put the fish to soak in very cold water for an hour or
so. When the fish is to be cooked sliced, divide it up as soon
as it is caught, and put the slices to soak in very cold water, as
in the case of the whole fish.</p>

<p>But does this barbarous method, which stiffens and contracts
the flesh of the fish, affect its quality so materially as connoisseurs
would have us believe?</p>

<p>It is very difficult to say, and opinions on the matter are
divided. This, however, is certain, that fish prepared in the
way above described is greatly relished by many.</p>

<p>Whether whole or sliced, crimped fish is always boiled in
salted water. Its cooking presents a real difficulty, in that it
must be stopped at the precise moment when it is completed,
any delay in this respect proving prejudicial to the quality of
the dish.</p>

<p>Crimped fish is served like the boiled kind, and all the
sauces suited to the latter likewise obtain with the former.
Besides the selected sauce, send a sauceboat to the table containing
some of the cooking-liquor of the fish.</p>


<h3 title="Salmon (Saumon)">SALMON (SAUMON)</h3>

<p>Salmon caught on the Rhine, or Dutch salmon, is generally
considered the most delicate that may be had, though, in my
opinion, that obtained from certain English rivers, such, for
instance, as the Severn, is by no means inferior to the foregoing.
Here in England this excellent fish is held in the high
esteem it deserves, and the quantity consumed in this country
is considerable. It is served as plainly as possible, either
<a id="png.286" href="#png.286"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>boiled, cold or hot, grilled, or à la Meunière; but whatever be
the method of preparation, it is always accompanied by cucumber
salad.</p>

<p id="g_darne">The slices of salmon, however, thick or thin, large or small,
take the name of “Darnes.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="784—Boiled Salmon"><a id="rcp.784"
 >784—BOILED SALMON</a></h3>

<p>Boiled salmon, whether whole or sliced, should be cooked
in <i>court-bouillon</i> in accordance with directions given at the beginning
of the chapter (No. <a href="#rcp.776">776</a>). All fish sauces are suited
to it, but more especially the following, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span>Hollandaise
sauce, Mousseline sauce, Melted butter, Shrimp sauce, Nantua
sauce, Cardinal sauce, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Crimped</i> salmon admits of precisely the same sauces.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="785—Broiled Salmon"><a id="rcp.785"
 >785—BROILED SALMON</a></h3>

<p>Cut the salmon to be grilled in slices from one inch to one
and one-half inches thick. Season with table-salt, sprinkle
with melted butter or oil, and grill it for the first part on a
rather brisk fire, taking care to moderate the latter towards the
close of the operation. Allow about twenty-five minutes for
the grilling of a slice of salmon one and one-half inches thick.
Butter à la Maître d’Hôtel, anchovy butter, and devilled sauce
Escoffier are the most usual adjuncts to grilled salmon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="786—Saumon à la Meunière"><a id="rcp.786"
 >786—SAUMON <span class="nw">A LA MEUNIÈRE</span></a></h3>

<p>Having cut the salmon into moderately thick slices, season
these, dredge them slightly, and cook them in the frying-pan
with very hot clarified butter.</p>

<p>It is important that the salmon be set and that the cooking
be rapid.</p>

<p>Serve it in either of the two ways indicated above (No. <a href="#rcp.778">778</a>).</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Various Ways of Preparing Salmon">Various Ways of Preparing Salmon</h3>

<p>In addition to the three methods of serving salmon described
above, and those cold preparations with which I shall deal
later, the fish in question lends itself to a whole host of dressings
which are of the greatest utility in the varying of menus.
The principles of these dressings I shall now give.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="787—Cadgerée of Salmon"><a id="rcp.787"
 >787—CADGERÉE OF SALMON</a></h3>

<p>Prepare one lb. of cooked salmon, cleared of bones and
skin, and cut into small pieces; four hard-boiled eggs cut into
<a id="png.287" href="#png.287"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dice; one lb. of well-cooked pilaff rice; and three-quarters pint
of Béchamel flavoured with curry.</p>

<p>Dish in a hot timbale, alternating the various products, and
finish with a coating of sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="788—Côtelettes de Saumon"><a id="rcp.788"
 >788—CÔTELETTES<!-- TN: circumflex invisible --> DE SAUMON</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat for salmon, the quantity
whereof will be in accordance with the number of cutlets to
be made, and rub it through a coarse sieve. Line the bottom
and sides of some buttered tin moulds, shaped like cutlets, with
a coating one-half inch thick of the prepared forcemeat.</p>

<p>Fill the moulds to within one-third inch of their brims with
a cold <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of mushrooms and truffles, thickened by means
of reduced Allemande sauce, and cover this with the forcemeat.</p>

<p>Set the cutlets to poach, turn out the moulds; treat the
cutlets <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and cook them with clarified butter.</p>

<p>Arrange in a circle round a dish, put a frill on a piece of
fried bread counterfeiting the bone of the cutlet, garnish with
fried parsley, and send to the table, separately, a “Dieppoise”
sauce, Shrimp sauce, or a purée of fresh vegetables, such as
peas, carrots, &amp;c. In the latter case, serve at the same time
a sauce in keeping with the garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="789—Coulibiac de Saumon"><a id="rcp.789"
 >789—COULIBIAC DE SAUMON</a></h3>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Have ready two lbs. of ordinary brioche paste
without sugar (No. <a href="#rcp.2368">2368</a>). Stiffen in butter one and one-half lbs. of small salmon collops, and prepare one-sixth lb. of mushrooms
and one chopped onion (both of which should be fried
in butter), one-half lb. of semolina kache (No. <a href="#rcp.2292">2292</a>) or the
same weight of rice cooked in consommé; two hard-boiled eggs,
chopped; and one lb. of <i><a href="#g_vesiga">vesiga</a></i>, roughly chopped and cooked
in consommé.</p>

<p>For this weight of cooked <i><a href="#g_vesiga">vesiga</a></i> about two and one-half oz.
of dried <i><a href="#g_vesiga">vesiga</a></i> will be needed, which should be soaked for at
least four hours in cold water, and then cooked for three and
one-half hours in white consommé. It may also be cooked in
water.</p>

<p>Roll the brioche paste into rectangles twelve inches long
by eight inches wide, and spread thereon in successive layers
the kache or the rice, the collops of salmon, the chopped
<i><a href="#g_vesiga">vesiga</a></i>, the eggs, the mushrooms, and the onion, and finish with
a layer of kache or rice. Moisten the edges of the paste and
draw the longest ends of it towards each other over the
<a id="png.288" href="#png.288"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>enumerated layers of garnish, and join them so as to properly enclose
the latter.</p>

<p>Now fold the two remaining ends over to the centre in a
similar way. Place the coulibiac thus formed on a baking-tray,
and take care to turn it over in order that the joining
parts of the paste lie underneath.</p>

<p>Set the paste to rise for twenty-five minutes, sprinkle some
melted butter over the coulibiac, sprinkle with some very fine
raspings, make a slit in the top for the escape of vapour, and
bake in a moderate oven for forty-five or fifty minutes. Fill
the coulibiac with freshly-melted butter when withdrawing it
from the oven.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Darnes de Saumon">Darnes de Saumon</h3>

<p>The few recipes dealing with “<a href="#g_darne">Darnes</a> de Saumon,” which
I give below, may also be adapted to whole salmon after the
size of the fish has been taken into account in measuring the
time allowed for cooking.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="790—Darne de Saumon Chambord"><a id="rcp.790"
 >790—DARNE DE SAUMON CHAMBORD</a></h3>

<p>As already explained, the term “<a href="#g_darne">darne</a>” stands for a piece
of salmon cut from the middle of that fish, and the size of a
<a href="#g_darne">darne</a> is in proportion to the number of people it is intended
for.</p>

<p>Proceed after the manner directed under “The Braising of
Fish” (No. <a href="#rcp.780">780</a>); moisten in the proportion of two-thirds with
excellent red wine and one-third with fish stock, calculating the
quantity in such wise that it may cover no more than two-thirds
of the depth of the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a>. Bring to the boil, then set to braise
gently, and glaze the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> at the last moment.</p>

<p><i>Garnish and Sauce.</i>—Garnish with quenelles of truffled
<i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat for fish, moulded by means of a spoon;
two large ornamented quenelles; truffles fashioned like olives;
pieces of milt dipped in Villeroy sauce, treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> and
fried when about to dish up; small gudgeon or smelts treated
similarly to the milt, and trussed crayfish cooked in <i>court-bouillon</i>.</p>

<p>The sauce is a Genevoise, made from the reduced cooking-liquor
of the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a>.</p>

<p><i>Dishing Up.</i>—Surround the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> by the garnishes enumerated,
arranging them tastefully, and pierce it with two
<i><a href="#g_hatelet">hatelets</a></i>, each garnished with a small truffle, an ornamented
quenelle, and a crayfish.</p>

<p>Send the sauce to the table separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="791—Darne de Saumon Daumont"><a id="png.289" href="#png.289"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Poach the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> in a <i>court-bouillon</i> prepared beforehand.</p>

<p><i>Dishing Up and Garnish.</i>—Surround the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> by medium-sized
mushrooms stewed in butter and garnished with small
crayfish tails cohered by means of a few tablespoonfuls of
Nantua sauce; small round quenelles of <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat
for fish, decorated with truffles, and some slices of milt treated
<a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and fried when about to dish up.</p>

<p>Serve the Nantua sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="792—Darne de Saumon Lucullus"><a id="rcp.792"
 >792—DARNE DE SAUMON LUCULLUS</a></h3>

<p>Skin one side of the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a>, lard it with truffles, and braise
it in champagne.</p>

<p><i>The Garnish Round the <a href="#g_darne">Darne</a>.</i>—Very small garnished
patties of crayfish tails; small <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> of milt; small <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>
of oysters, poached in <i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Sauce.</i>—The braising-liquor of the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> finished by means
of ordinary and crayfish butter in equal quantities. Send it to
the table separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="793—Darne de Saumon Nesselrode"><a id="rcp.793"
 >793—DARNE DE SAUMON NESSELRODE</a></h3>

<p>Remove the spine and all other internal bones. Stuff the
<a href="#g_darne">darne</a> with raw lobster <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> stiffened by means of a little
pike forcemeat.</p>

<p>Line a well-buttered, round and even raised-pie mould with
a thin layer of hot-water, raised-pie paste (this is made from one lb. of flour, four oz. of lard, one egg, and a little lukewarm
water), which should be prepared in advance and made somewhat
stiff. Now garnish the inside of the pie with thin slices
of bacon and place the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> upright in it. (To simplify the
operation the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> may be stuffed at this stage.) Cover the pie
with a layer of the same paste, pinch its edges with those of the
original lining, make a slit in the top for the steam to escape,
and cook in a good oven.</p>

<p>When the pie is almost baked, prod it repeatedly with a
larding-needle; when the latter is withdrawn clear of all stuffing
the pie should be taken from the oven. This done, turn it upside
down in order to drain away the melted bacon and other
liquids inside it, but do not let it drop from the mould. Then
tilt it on to a dish and take off the mould. Do not break the
crust except at the dining-table.</p>

<p><i>Sauce.</i>—Serve an American sauce with the pie, the former
being prepared from the remains of the lobsters used in making
the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, finished with cream, and garnished with very fine
oysters (cleared of their beards), poached when about to dish up.</p>

slices of milt, and trussed crayfish cooked in <i>court-bouillon</i>.</p>

<p>Send a Valois sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="797—Mousseline de Saumon"><a id="rcp.797"
 >797—MOUSSELINE DE SAUMON</a></h3>

<p>In Part I. I dealt with the preparation of <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat
(No. <a href="#rcp.195">195</a>), and also the method of poaching spoon-moulded
quenelles (No. <a href="#rcp.205">205</a>). Now <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> are only large quenelles
which derive their name from the very light forcemeat of which
they are composed. These <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> quenelles are always
moulded with the ordinary tablespoon, they are garnished on
top with a fine, raw slice of the fish under treatment, and
poached after the manner already described.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="798—Mousseline Alexandra"><a id="rcp.798"
 >798—MOUSSELINE ALEXANDRA</a></h3>

<p>Having made the salmon <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat, mould the
quenelles and place them, one by one, in a buttered sautépan.
Place a small, round and very thin slice of salmon on each, and
poach them in a very moderate oven with lid on the utensil containing
them.</p>

<p>Drain on a piece of linen, arrange them in a circle on a dish,
place a slice of truffle upon each slice of salmon, coat with
Mornay sauce, and glaze.</p>

<p>Garnish the centre of the dish with very small peas or
asparagus-heads cohered with butter just before dishing up.</p>

 >799—MOUSSELINE DE SAUMON <span class="nw">A LA TOSCA</span></a></h3>

<p>Combine one and one-half oz. of crayfish cream-cullis with
each pound of the salmon <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat. Mould and
poach as above, drain, and arrange in a circle on a dish.</p>

<p>Garnish each <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> with a thin slice of milt cooked in
lightly-browned butter, four crayfish tails cut lengthwise into
two, and a slice of truffle at each end. Coat with a light Mornay
sauce, finished with crayfish butter, and glaze quickly.</p>

<p>N.B.—In addition to these two recipes, all the garnishes
suitable for fillets of sole may be applied to <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>.
Garnishes of early-season vegetable purées also suit them admirably,
and therein lies an almost inexhaustible source of variety.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="800—Cold Salmon"><a id="rcp.800"
 >800—COLD SALMON</a></h3>

<p>When salmon is to be served cold it should, as far as possible,
be cooked, either whole or in large pieces, in the <i>court-bouillon</i>
given under No. <a href="#rcp.163">163</a> and cooled in the latter. Pieces
cooked separately may seem better or may be more easily made
to look sightly, but their meat is drier than that of the salmon
cooked whole. And what is lost in appearance with the very
large pieces is more than compensated for by their extra
quality.</p>

<p>In dishing cold salmon the skin may be removed and the
fillets bared, so that the fish may be more easily decorated, but
the real gourmet will always prefer the salmon served in its
natural silver vestment.</p>

<p>In decorating cold salmon use pieces of cucumber, anchovy
fillets, capers, slices of tomato, curled-leaf parsley, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am not partial to the decorating of salmon with softened
butter, coloured or not, laid on by means of the piping-bag.
Apart from the fact that this method of decoration is rarely
artistic, the butter used combines badly with the cold sauces
and the meat of the salmon on the diner’s plate. Very green
tarragon leaves, chervil, lobster coral, &amp;c., afford a more
natural and more delicate means of ornamentation. The only
butter fit to be served with cold salmon is Montpellier butter
(No. <a href="#rcp.153">153</a>), though this, in fact, is but a cold sauce often resorted
to for the coating of the cold fish in question.</p>

<p>Among the garnishes which suit cold salmon, I might mention
small peeled, and emptied tomatoes garnished with some
kind of salad; hard-boiled eggs, either wholly stuffed, or stuffed

<p>Having drained and dried the salmon or the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a>, remove
the skin from one of its sides, and coat the bared fillets with
a layer of a preparation of <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> de saumon, letting it lie
rather more thickly over the middle than the sides. Coat the
layer of <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> with mayonnaise sauce thickened by means of

<p>Now let some clear fish jelly set on the bottom of the dish to
be sent to the table; place the salmon or the <a href="#g_darne">darne</a> on this jelly,
and surround the piece with a border consisting of Montpellier
butter, using for the purpose a piping-bag fitted with a grooved
pipe.</p>

<p>Decorate the centre of the piece by means of a fine fleur-de-lys
made from truffles, and encircle it with two royale crowns
made from anchovy fillets.</p>

<p>Coat the garnish with a little melted fish aspic so as to fix it.</p>

<p>This done, sprinkle the piece, again and again, with the

very clear, melted jelly.</p>

<p>When dishing up, incrust the receptacle<!-- TN: original reads "receptable" --> containing the fish

<h3 class="recipe" title="807—Côtelettes Froides de Saumon"><a id="rcp.807"
 >807—CÔTELETTES<!-- TN: circumflex invisible --> FROIDES DE SAUMON</a></h3>

<p>Liberally butter some tin cutlet-shaped moulds. Line their
bottoms and sides with a very red slice of salmon, as thin as a
piece of cardboard. This slice should be long enough to project
outside the brim of the mould to the extent of one-half inch.</p>

<p>Garnish the insides of the moulds with well-seasoned salmon
meat, and draw the projecting lengths of salmon across this
meat so as to enclose the latter and finish off the cutlets.</p>

<p>Arrange the moulds on a baking-tray; poach the cutlets,
dry, in a moderate oven; turn them out of their moulds on to
another tray as soon as they are poached, and let them cool.
Then coat them with a half-melted aspic, and decorate them
according to fancy, either with very green peas or a leaf of
chervil with a bit of lobster coral in its centre—in a word, something
simple and neat.</p>

<p>These cutlets, which are generally served at ball-suppers,
may be dished on a tazza, on a cushion of rice, semolina, corn-flour,
or stearine, and laid almost vertically against a pyramid
of vegetable salad cohered by means of mayonnaise with
aspic. In this case the dish is finished off with a <i><a href="#g_hatelet">hatelet</a></i> stuck
into the middle of the pyramid.</p>

<p>The cutlets may also be arranged in a circle on a flat, shallow,
silver or crystal dish, and covered with a delicate cold
melted jelly.</p>

<p>Whatever be the selected method of dishing, always send
to the table with the cutlet a sauceboat of cold sauce.</p>

<p>Coat them, according to their purpose, either with mayonnaise

whole is seasoned in precisely the same way as an ordinary
salad.</p>


<h3 title="Trout">TROUT.</h3>

<p>From the culinary standpoint, trout are divided into two
quite distinct classes, viz., large trout, whereof the typical
specimen is Salmon-trout, and small or fresh-water trout.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="811—Truite Saumonée (Salmon Trout)"><a id="rcp.811"
 >811—TRUITE SAUMONÉE<!-- TN: acute invisible --> (Salmon Trout)</a></h3>

<p>In its many preparations, salmon-trout may be replaced
by salmon, and all the recipes relating to the former may be
adapted to the latter.</p>

<p>In any case, however, as its size is less than that of salmon,
it is very rarely cut into <a href="#g_darne">darnes</a>, being more generally served
whole.</p>

<p>The few recipes that follow are proper to salmon-trout.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="812—Truite à la Cambacérès"><a id="rcp.812"
 >812—TRUITE <span class="nw">A LA CAMBACÉRÈS</span><!-- TN: original reads "CAMBACERÈS" --></a></h3>

<p>Select a male trout in preference; clean it, and remove its
gills without opening it in the region of the belly.</p>

<p><a id="png.296" href="#png.296"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Skin it on one side, starting at a distance of one inch from
the head and finishing within two and one-half inches of the
root of the tail.</p>

<p>Lard the bared portions with truffles and the red part only
of carrots cut into rods.</p>

<p>This done, spread out a napkin, lay the trout thereon, belly
under, and, with a sharp knife, separate the two fillets from
the bones, beginning in the region of the head and proceeding
straight down to where the body converges towards the
tail.</p>

<p>The spine being thus liberated, sever it at both ends; <i>i.e.</i>,
from the tail and the head, and withdraw it, together with all
the adhering ventral bones. The intestines are then removed, the
inside of the fish is well cleaned, the fillets are seasoned on their
insides, and the trout is stuffed with a <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat of
raw crayfish. The two fillets are drawn together, and the trout,
thus reconstructed, is covered with thin slices of bacon and laid
on the drainer of the fish-kettle and braised in Sauterne wine.</p>

<p>When the fish is done, remove the slices of bacon, glaze it,
and dish it up. Surround it with alternate heaps of morels
tossed in butter and milt à la Meunière.</p>

<p>Send to the table, separately, a fine Béchamel sauce, combined
with the braising-liquor of the trout, strained and reduced,
and finished with crayfish butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="813—Truites Saumonées Froides"><a id="rcp.813"
 >813—TRUITES SAUMONÉES FROIDES</a></h3>

<p>We are now concerned with a whole series of unpublished
“Trout” preparations, which are at once of superfine delicacy
and agreeable aspect, and which admit of clean and easy
dishing.</p>

<p>Cook a trout weighing from two to three lbs. in <i>court-bouillon</i>,
and let it cool in the latter. Then drain it; sever
the head and tail from the body, and put them aside. Completely
skin the whole fish, and carefully separate the two fillets
from the bones.</p>

<p>Deck each fillet with tarragon and chervil leaves, lobster
coral, poached white of eggs, &amp;c., and set them, back to back,
upon a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> of tomatoes lying in a special, long white or
coloured porcelain dish about one and one-half to two inches
deep.</p>

<p>Replace the head and tail, and cover the whole with a coating
of half-melted, succulent fish aspic, somewhat clear. Let
the aspic set, and incrust the dish containing the trout in a
block of ice, or surround it with the latter broken.</p>



<h3 class="recipe" title="814—Préparation de la Mousse de Tomates"><a id="png.297" href="#png.297"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.814"
 >814—PREPARATION DE LA MOUSSE DE TOMATES</a></h3>

<p>This <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, like those which I shall give later, is really a
<i>bavarois</i> without sugar. Its recipe is exactly the same as that
of the “<i>bavarois</i> of fruit,” except with regard to the question
of sugar.</p>

<p>Cook one-half lb. of tomato pulp (cleared of skin and seeds,
and roughly chopped) in one oz. of butter. When the pulp
has thoroughly mingled with the butter, add thereto two tablespoonfuls
of velouté thickened by means of eight leaves of
gelatine per quart of the sauce.</p>

<p>Rub through tammy, and add to the preparation, when
almost cold, half of its volume of barely-whipped cream. Taste
the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>; season with a few drops of lemon juice, and if it
still seems flat, add the necessary salt and a very little cayenne.</p>

<p>N.B.—It will be seen that I prescribe cream only half-whipped.
This precaution, however, does not apply to
“Mousse de Tomates” alone, but to all <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>. Well-whipped
cream imparts a dry and woolly taste to them, whereas,
when it is only half-whipped, it renders them unctuous and
fresh to the palate.</p>

<p>From the point of view of delicacy, the respective results of
the two methods do not bear comparison.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="815—Other Preparations of Trout after the same Recipe"><a id="rcp.815"
 >815—OTHER PREPARATIONS OF TROUT <span class="nw">after the same recipe</span></a></h3>

<p>By proceeding exactly as directed in the foregoing recipe,
and by substituting one of the following <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> for the
“Mousse de Tomates,” it will be found that considerable
variety may be introduced into <span class="nw">menus:—</span></p>

<p>1. <b>Crayfish <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with crayfish
tails and tarragon leaves.</p>

<p>2. <b>Lobster <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with slices of
lobster, coral, and chervil.</p>

<p>3. <b>Shrimp <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with crayfish
tails and capers.</p>

<p>4. <b>Capsicum <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with strips
of grilled capsicum.</p>

<p>5. <b>Physalia <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with chervil,
tarragon, and bunches of physalia around the fillets.</p>

<p>6. <b>Green Pimentos <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with
strips of green pimentos.</p>

<p>7. <b>Early-season Herb <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked

<p>8. <b>Volnay <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout, decked with anchovy
fillets, capers, and olives.</p>

<p><a id="png.298" href="#png.298"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a>9. <b>Chambertin <a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></b> with fillets of trout decked like <a href="#rcp.8">No. 8</a>.</p>

<p>N.B.—In the making of “Mousse au Volnay” and “au
Chambertin” the base of the preparations is supplied by cleared
velouté, to which is added the reduced cooking-liquor of the
trout.</p>

<p>All these recipes are equally suitable for sole or chicken-turbot.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="815a—Ondines aux Crevettes Roses"><a id="rcp.815a"
 >815a—ONDINES AUX CREVETTES ROSES</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a very delicate trout <a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a>, mould it in egg-moulds,
and garnish the centre with trimmed prawns’ tails. Let the
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> set; then speedily turn the ondines<!-- TN: original reads "undines" --> out of their moulds,
and lay them in a deep entrée-dish. Between each of them lay
a few prawns, the tails of which should be shelled. Cover
the whole, little by little, with some excellent, half-melted jelly;
here and there add a few sprigs of chervil, and then fill up
the dish with jelly, so as to completely cover the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="816—Fresh-water Trout"><a id="rcp.816"
 >816—FRESH-WATER TROUT</a></h3>

<p>The best are those procured in mountainous districts, where
the clear water they inhabit is constantly refreshed by strong
currents.</p>

<p>The two leading methods of preparing them are called, respectively,
“Au bleu” and “à la Meunière.” Having already
described the latter, I shall now give my attention to “Truite
au bleu.”</p>

<p>This preparation is held in very high esteem in Switzerland
and Germany, where fresh-water trout are not only plentiful, but
of excellent quality.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="817—Truites au Bleu"><a id="rcp.817"
 >817—TRUITES AU BLEU</a></h3>

<p>The essential condition for this dish consists in having live
trout. Prepare a <i>court-bouillon</i> with plenty of vinegar (No. <a href="#rcp.163">163</a>), and keep it boiling in a rather shallow basin.</p>

<p>About ten minutes before dishing them, take the trout out
of water; stun them by a blow on the head; empty and clean
them very quickly, and plunge them into the boiling liquid,
where they will immediately shrivel, while their skin will break
in all directions.</p>

<p>A few minutes will suffice to cook trout the average weight
of which is one-third lb.</p>

<p>Drain them and dish them immediately upon a napkin, with
curled-leaf parsley all round. Serve them with a Hollandaise
sauce or melted butter.</p>

<p><a id="png.299" href="#png.299"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>N.B.—Fresh-water trout may also be served fried or grilled,
but neither of these methods of preparation suits them so well
as “à la Meunière” or “au bleu,” which I have given.</p>


<h3 title="Soles">SOLES.</h3>

<p>Sole may be served whole or filleted, and a large number
of the recipes given for the whole fish may be adapted to its
fillets.</p>

<p>As a rule, the fillets are made to appear on the menu of a
dinner owing to the fact that they dish more elegantly and are
more easily served than the whole fish, the latter being generally
served at luncheons.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in cases where great ceremony is not observed
at a dinner, soles may well be served whole, inasmuch as no
hard-and-fast rule has ever obtained in this matter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="818—Sole Alice"><a id="rcp.818"
 >818—SOLE ALICE</a></h3>

<p>This sole is prepared, or rather its preparation is completed,
at the table.</p>

<p>Have an excellent fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> (No. <a href="#rcp.11">11</a>), short and very white.
Trim the sole; put it into a special, deep earthenware dish, the
bottom of which should be buttered; pour the <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> over it and
poach gently.</p>

<p>Now send it to the table with a plate containing separate
heaps of one finely-chopped onion, a little powdered thyme, and
three finely-crushed <a href="#g_biscottes"><i>biscottes</i></a>.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the waiter places the dish on a chafer,
and, taking off the sole, he raises the fillets therefrom, and
places them between two hot plates. He then adds to the
cooking-liquor of the sole the chopped onion, which he leaves
to cook for a few moments, the powdered thyme and a sufficient
quantity of the <a href="#g_biscottes"><i>biscotte</i></a> raspings to allow of thickening the
whole.</p>

<p>At the last minute he adds six raw oysters and one oz. of
butter divided into small pieces.</p>

<p>As soon as the oysters are stiff, he returns the fillets of sole
to the dish, besprinkles them copiously with the sauce, and then
serves them very hot.</p>

<p>N.B.—In order to promote the poaching of the soles, more
particularly when they are large, the fillets on the upper side
of the fish should be slightly separated from the bones. By this
means the heat is able to reach the inside of the fish very
quickly, and the operation is accelerated.</p>

<p><a id="png.300" href="#png.300"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The sole is always laid on the dish with its opened side
undermost—that is to say, on its back.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="819—Sole Mornay"><a id="rcp.819"
 >819—SOLE MORNAY</a></h3>

<p>Lay the sole on a buttered dish; sprinkle a little fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>
over it, and add one-half oz. of butter divided into small pieces.
Poach gently.</p>

<p>Coat the bottom of the dish on which the sole is to be served
with Mornay sauce; drain the fish, lay it on the prepared dish;
cover it with the same sauce; sprinkle with grated Gruyère
and Parmesan, and glaze at a Salamander.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="820—Sole Mornay des Provençaux"><a id="rcp.820"
 >820—SOLE MORNAY DES PROVENÇAUX</a></h3>

<p>This sole, which used to be served at the famous restaurant
of the “Frères Provençaux,” was prepared, and always may be
prepared, as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Poach the sole in fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> and butter, as directed in the
preceding recipe; drain it, and place it on a dish; cover it with
white-wine sauce; sprinkle liberally with grated cheese, and
glaze quickly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="821—Sole au Champagne"><a id="rcp.821"
 >821—SOLE AU CHAMPAGNE</a></h3>

<p>Poach the sole in a buttered dish with one-half pint of
champagne. Dish it; reduce its cooking-liquor to half; add
thereto one-sixth pint of velouté, and complete with one and
one-half oz. of best butter.</p>

<p>Cover the sole with this sauce; glaze, and garnish each side
of the dish with a little heap of a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of filleted sole,
seasoned, dredged, and tossed in clarified butter at the last
moment in order to have it very crisp.</p>

<p>N.B.—By substituting a good white wine for the champagne,
a variety of dishes may be made, among which may be mentioned:
Soles au Chablis, Soles au Sauterne, Sole au Samos,
Sole au Château<!-- TN: circumflex invisible --> Yquem, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="822—Sole Colbert"><a id="rcp.822"
 >822—SOLE COLBERT</a></h3>

<p>On the upper side of the fish separate the fillets from the
spine, and break the latter in several places. Dip the sole in
milk; roll it in flour; treat it <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and roll the separated
fillets back a little, so that they may be quite free from the
bones.</p>

<p>Fry; drain on a piece of linen; remove the bones, and fill
the resulting space with butter à la Maître<!-- TN: original reads "Maitre" --> d’Hôtel.</p>

<p>Serve the sole on a very hot dish.</p>

<h3 title="Fillets of Sole">FILLETS OF SOLE</h3>

<p>Subject to the kind of dish required, fillets of sole are either
kept in their natural state, they are stuffed and folded over, or
they are simply folded over without being stuffed, each of which
methods of preparation will be specially referred to in the
recipes.</p>

<p>Whatever be the method adopted, always skin the fillets
thoroughly; <i>i.e.</i>, remove the thin membrane which lies beneath
the skin, the tendency of which, during the cooking process, is
to shrink and thereby disfigure the fillet.</p>

<p>This done, flatten out the fillets with the broad side of a wet
knife, and trim them slightly if necessary. The poaching of
fillets of sole must be effected without allowing the cooking-liquor
to boil, the object being to prevent the pieces losing their
shape. Fillets should also be kept very white.</p>

<p>In cases where the exact amount of the poaching-liquor is
not given, allow one-quarter pint to every four fillets, <i>i.e.</i>, to
every sole.</p>

and coat with American sauce, prepared with curry and combined
with the meat of the lobster (cut into small dice) which
has served in the preparation of the sauce. Take care that no
sauce touches the scroll-work, which should remain well-defined.</p>

<p>2. Bake some large potatoes in the oven. Open them; remove
their pulp, and put into each baked shell a tablespoonful
of American sauce au currie referred to above. Add a poached
fillet of sole; coat with American sauce; dish these garnished

<p>The directions given under “<i>Mousselines de</i> Saumon” (No. <a href="#rcp.797">797</a>) apply in all circumstances to <i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousselines</a></i> of Sole. I shall

admit of all the fish sauces and garnishes, and that
they may also be accompanied by all purées of fresh vegetables.</p>

 >907—TURBAN DE FILETS DE SOLES <span class="nw">A LA VILLARET</span></a></h3>

<p>Raise the fillets of three soles; flatten them slightly with a
moistened beater, and trim them very straight on either side.</p>

<p>Liberally butter a medium-sized <a href="#g_savarin">savarin-mould</a>. Lay the
fillets aslant in this mould, with their tail-ends over-reaching
its inner edge and their other ends projecting over its outer
edge; slip a fine slice of truffle between each, and let them
slightly overlap one another.</p>

<p>When the mould is completely lined with the fillets of sole,
fill it up with lobster <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat. Gently tap the
mould on a folded napkin lying on the table, with the object
of settling the forcemeat, and then draw the overhanging ends
of the fillets across the latter.</p>

<p>Set to poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>This done, take the mould out of the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>; let it stand
for a few minutes, and then turn it upside-down upon the dish.
Leave it to drain; soak up the liquid that has leaked out on to
the dish; take off the mould, and moisten the surface of the
fillets by means of a small brush dipped in melted butter. The
object of this last measure is to glaze the fish and to remove
therefrom the froth resulting from its poached albumen.</p>

<p>Now garnish the centre of the moulding with shrimps’
tails, mushrooms, poached milt, and slices of truffle, the whole
cohered by means of Béchamel sauce finished with lobster
butter.</p>

<p>Proceed as in the preceding recipe, but alternate the fillets
of sole with very red slices of salmon of the same size as the
fillets.</p>

<p>The combination yields an excellent result, and the varying
strips of white and orange which constitute the body of the
moulded crown lend sightliness to the dish.</p>

<p>N.B.—The designation “à la Villaret,” relating to the crown
alone, in no wise affects the constituents of the garnish; these
may either remain the same as those of the preceding recipe, or
may be replaced by something similar. The sauce alone
remains unalterable, and this should be a good Béchamel
finished with lobster butter.</p>

diameter of which should be greater than the height; line it
with fine, short paste, and decorate it with noodle paste.</p>

<p>Raise the fillets of three medium-sized soles, flatten them
slightly; coat them with whiting forcemeat prepared with crayfish
butter, and roll them into scroll-form. Also prepare ten
small slices of the meat of a medium-sized ordinary or spiny
lobster’s tail, ten small grooved and cooked mushrooms, fifteen
slices of truffle, and three-quarters pint of Cardinal sauce
finished with a lobster butter.</p>

<p>When about to serve, lay the poached, rolled fillets of sole
(well drained) in a circle round the bottom of the timbale; put
the slices of lobster and the mushrooms in the centre, and
cover the whole with Cardinal sauce.</p>

<p>Set upon the sauce, just over the centre of the timbale, a
large, grooved mushroom (cooked and kept very white), and
encircle the latter with fifteen slices of truffle.</p>

<p>Place the timbale, thus garnished, on a folded napkin lying

<p><span class="nw">Prepare:—</span>(1) A rather deep timbale crust, and decorate
it with noodle paste. (2) Cook, as for bisque, twenty-four small

and keep them hot in butter. (3) Finely pound the <i><a href="#g_langoustine">langoustines</a>’</i>
carapaces, and add thereto one-third pint of fine
Béchamel. Rub through a fine sieve first, and then through

<p>Flatten the fillets of three medium-sized soles, and trim them
neatly.</p>

<p>Liberally butter a pound-cake mould, and line it with the
fillets, placing them side by side with their tails lying round
the centre of the bottom of the mould, and their opposite ends
projecting above the brim. Press them well, that they may take
the shape of the mould.</p>

<p>Completely coat the fillets with a layer, one-half inch thick,
of fish forcemeat.</p>

<p>Put the mould in the front of the oven for a few minutes
<a id="png.324" href="#png.324"><span class="pagenum"><span

gives the required firmness to the timbale.</p>

<p>When the forcemeat has been poached and is stiff, withdraw
the timbale from the oven, and cut off the pieces of fillet
that project above the edges of the mould. Fill the timbale
to within one-third inch of its brim with a garnish of shrimps
and poached oysters and mussels, small button-mushrooms, and
slices of truffle, all of which should be cohered with a thick
and highly-seasoned Béchamel sauce. Cover this garnish with
the projecting pieces of fillets, already cut off, and close the
timbale by means of a thin layer of that forcemeat which served
in coating the fillets. Poach for thirty minutes in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>

 >914—The Preparation of PAUPIETTES OF FILLETS OF SOLE SALMON, &amp;c.</a></h3>

<p>The <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i> (or fillets rolled after the manner of a scroll)
are served either as entrées like fillets of sole, of which they are
but a special kind, or as a garnish. For the second purpose,
not only should they be smaller than for the first, but very
small fillets are generally selected for the preparation of the
<i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>.</p>

<p>In order to make <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>, first remove the nervous film
from the outside surfaces of the fillets, and then slightly flatten
the latter with the blade of a large knife; trim them on both
sides, and coat them on their flayed side with a thin layer of fish
forcemeat, truffled or not, in accordance with the requirements.</p>

<p><a id="png.325" href="#png.325"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>307<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Now roll them into scroll-form; smooth the forcemeat that
projects from the top end, and the <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i> are done.</p>

<p>Stand them upright in a buttered sautépan to poach, and
take care to place them snugly together lest they lose their
shape while the operation is in progress. Moisten them with
sufficient fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> (No. <a href="#rcp.11">11</a>) to cover them; poach them in a
moderate oven, and remember, as in the case of fillets of sole,
not to let the poaching-liquor boil.</p>

<p>All the garnishes and sauces suited to fillets of sole likewise
obtain with <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>, provided the difference in their shape be
taken into account when dishing up.</p>

<p>For salmon <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>, cut slices two-thirds inch wide, one-half
inch thick, and the length of a fillet of sole, from a skinned
fillet of salmon. In view of the unusual fragility of salmon’s
flesh, the slices of fillets should be carefully flattened in order
to give them the width and thickness of a fillet of sole. This
done, spread forcemeat on them, and roll them as explained
above.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="915—Aspic de Filets de Soles"><a id="rcp.915"
 >915—ASPIC DE FILETS DE SOLES</a></h3>

<p>An essential point in the making of an aspic is the clearness
of the fish jelly. For a sole aspic, take some white fish aspic,
which is at once succulent, limpid, and just sufficiently viscous
to allow of its being turned out of a mould without breaking.</p>

<p>For the purpose under consideration, moulds with plain
or decorated borders are generally used, and there are two
modes of <span class="nw">procedure:—</span></p>

<p>1. For a mould capable of holding one quart, fold twelve
small fillets of sole and poach them in butter and lemon juice,
taking care to keep them very white. This done, set them to
cool under a light weight.</p>

<p>Pour a few tablespoonfuls of melted fish jelly into the mould,
which should be lying amidst broken ice. As soon as the jelly
begins to set, decorate it tastefully with pieces (lozenges, crescents, &amp;c.) of very black truffle and the poached white of an
egg. Capers, tarragon leaves, thin roundels of small radishes, &amp;c., may also be used for the purpose of decoration.</p>

<p>When this part of the procedure has been satisfactorily
effected, sprinkle a few drops of the same jelly over the decorating
particles, in order to fix them and prevent their shifting
during the subsequent stages of the process. Now add enough
melted jelly to cover the bottom of the mould with a layer one
inch thick, and leave this to set.</p>

<p><a id="png.326" href="#png.326"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>308<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>On this set jelly, arrange the six fillets of sole; let their tail-ends
overlap, and cover them with jelly. Continue adding
coat upon coat of jelly until the thickness covering the fillets
measures about one-half inch.</p>

<p>Now arrange the remaining fillets in the reverse order, and
fill up the mould with cold, melted jelly. Leave to cool for
one hour.</p>

<p>When about to serve, quickly dip the mould in a saucepan
of hot water; wipe it, and turn out the aspic upon a folded
napkin lying on a dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="916—Another Method of Preparing Aspics de Filets de Soles"><a id="rcp.916"
 >916—Another Method of Preparing ASPICS DE FILETS DE SOLES</a></h3>

<p>Coat ten fine fillets of sole with a thin layer of truffled
fish forcemeat finished with crayfish butter, and roll them round
a little rod of truffle, twice as thick as an ordinary penholder.
Tie these <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>, once or twice round, with cotton; poach
them very gently in fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> and cool them on ice. Take
a border-mould, even if possible; pour therein a few tablespoonfuls
of melted fish jelly, and then rock it about on broken
ice, with the object of evenly coating it with a thin layer of
the jelly.</p>

<p id="g_clothe">This operation is technically called “clothing the mould.”</p>

<p>Decorate the bottom of the mould as explained above; fix
the decorating particles, and cover them with a layer one-half
inch thick of fish jelly.</p>

<p>After having properly trimmed the ends of the <i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i>,
cut them into roundels one-half inch thick; set these upright
against the sides of the mould, keeping them close together;
add a few drops of melted jelly to fix the roundels, and as soon
as this has set, add a further quantity, sufficient to completely
cover them.</p>

<p>As soon as this jelly sets, repeat the operation with the
<i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiette</a></i> roundels and the jelly, and do so again and again until
the mould is filled. For turning out the aspic, proceed as
directed above.</p>

shelled tail of a crayfish on each roundel of milt.</p>

<p>Arrange the tomatoes in a circle round a dish; surround
them with little triangles of white fish jelly, and garnish the

 >921—DOMINOS DE FILETS DE SOLES</a></h3>

<p>Select some fine, fleshy fillets; slightly flatten them; poach
them in a little of the cooking-liquor of mushrooms, some
lemon juice and butter, and set them to cool under a light
weight. When the fillets are cold, trim them and cut them
into regular rectangles the size of dominoes.</p>

<p>Coat the rectangles with a maigre, white, chaud-froid sauce;
decorate them in imitation of dominoes, with little spots of
truffle; glaze them with cold, melted fish jelly, and put them
aside.</p>

<p>Pound the trimmings of the fish together with their weight
of caviare, and rub the whole through a fine sieve. Add to
this preparation half its weight of highly-coloured jelly, and
leave it to set in a somewhat deep and moderately-oiled tray,
the thickness of the preparation on the tray being not greater
than that of a fillet of sole.</p>

<p>When the jelly is set, cut it into rectangles exactly the same
size as the prepared dominoes, and then, by means of a little
melted, cold jelly, fix the dominoes<!-- TN: original reads "diminoes" --> of sole to the rectangles
just prepared.</p>

<p>Put some chopped jelly in the centre of the dish, and on
this lay the dominoes in a muddled heap.</p>

<p>What I pointed out above, I repeat here for the reader’s
guidance—namely, that fillets of sole may be prepared after
all the recipes given for trout (No. <a href="#rcp.813">813</a>).</p>

<p>As the fillets of sole in this dish remain very conspicuous,
it is advisable to keep them very white in the poaching. Set
them to cool under a light weight, and decorate them in a
way that will be in keeping with the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> on which they are
dished. This <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> is set on a special dish, as already

<h3 class="recipe" title="923—Turbot"><a id="rcp.923"
 >923—TURBOT</a></h3>

<p>Turbot is generally served boiled, accompanied by freshly
cooked, floury potatoes, and the cases are exceptional when,
cooked in this way, it is dished with any other garnish.</p>

<p>All fish sauces may be served with turbot. When, for the
sake of variety, or in pursuance of the consumer’s wishes, turbot
has to be braised or garnished, it is best to select a medium-sized
<a id="png.329" href="#png.329"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fish, <i>i.e.</i>, one weighing from eight to twelve lbs., thick,
very fleshy, and white.</p>

<p>Unless expressly ordered, it is best to avoid surrounding the
piece with its garnish. Preferably, send the latter to the table
in a separate dish, as also the sauce. By this means the
service is expedited, and, more important still, the fish is
quite hot when it reaches the table. It is granted that the
sight of a dish containing a fine, richly garnished and tastefully
arranged piece is flattering to the host, but it would be
a pity that the quality of the fish should thereby suffer, more
particularly as the gourmet is not satisfied with sightliness
alone.</p>

<p>I explained at the beginning of this chapter, under “Boiled
Fish” (No. <a href="#rcp.776">776</a> and <a href="#rcp.779">779</a>), the details relating to this method
of cooking, especially with regard to its application to turbot.
For the braising and garnishing of turbot, the reader is begged
to refer to the recipes concerned with chicken-turbot. These
recipes may be applied to turbot, provided the difference in
the size of the fish be taken into account in reference to the
time allowed for braising and the quantities of the garnishing
ingredients.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="924—Cold Turbot"><a id="rcp.924"
 >924—COLD TURBOT</a></h3>

<p>Whether whole or sliced, cold turbot makes an excellent
dish, if the fish have not been cooked too long beforehand. It
will be found that turbot, especially when sliced, tends to
harden, crumple, and lose its flavour while cooling. It is therefore
of the greatest importance that the fish should have just
cooled after cooking, and that the cooking-liquor should have
barely time to set; otherwise the evil effects of cooling, mentioned
above, will surely ensue. When served, just cooled, with
one of the cold sauces suited to fish, turbot can vie in delicacy
even with such fish as salmon or trout, which are usually served
cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="925—Turbotins (Chicken-Turbots)"><a id="rcp.925"
 >925—TURBOTINS (CHICKEN-TURBOTS)</a></h3>

<p>Turbotins (chicken-turbots) may rank among the most delicate
and nicest of fish. Their varying sizes allow of their being
served either for three, four, or ten, or twelve people; they are,
moreover, tender and white, and they lend themselves to quite
a vast number of culinary preparations.</p>

<p>They may be served boiled, like the turbot; grilled; à la
Meunière; fried; <i>au <a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i>, like the soles; or braised, like the
salmon and the trout. They are most often served whole,
garnished and with sauce; but, in order to simplify the process,
they may be filleted, the fillets being poached and dished with
a garnish and the selected sauce.</p>

<p><a id="png.330" href="#png.330"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Whatever be the method of preparing the chicken-turbot,
whether it be boiled, poached, or braised, the spine should
always be cut in one or two places. The gash should be
just in the middle of the back where the flesh is thickest, and
the fillets on either side of the gash should be partly separated
from the bone. The object of this measure is to prevent deformation
during the cooking process and, also, to precipitate
the latter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="926—Turbotin à l’Amiral"><a id="rcp.926"
 >926—TURBOTIN <span class="nw">A L’AMIRAL</span></a></h3>

<p>Gash the back of the fish, and partly separate the under
fillets from the bones. Lay it on a grill, and moisten, sufficiently
to cover it, with previously-cooked <i>court-bouillon</i> with
Sauterne wine. As soon as the <i>court-bouillon</i> boils, allow the
fish to cook ten or twelve minutes for every two lbs. of its
weight.</p>

<p>This done, drain it; dish it, and coat it twice with melted,
red butter.</p>

<p>Now surround it with the following garnish, which should
be in proportion to the size of the fish, viz., little heaps of
large mussels and oysters, prepared à la Villeroy, and fried
at the time of dishing; small patties of crayfish tails; large
mushroom-heads grooved and cooked, and slices of truffle.</p>

<p>Serve, separately, (1) a timbale of potatoes <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>;
(2) Normande sauce, combined with one-sixth pint of reduced
<i>court-bouillon</i> per quart of sauce, finished with crayfish butter
and seasoned with cayenne.</p>

<p>Cut it in the region of the back; season it, and lay it in
a deep earthenware dish of convenient size, liberally buttered.
In the case of a chicken-turbot weighing two and one-half lbs.,
moisten with one-third pint of white wine and one-quarter pint
of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>

<p>Finely mince two medium-sized onions, and toss them in
butter until they have acquired a yellow colour.</p>

<p>Peel, press and mince three tomatoes, and add thereto three
large, raw, sliced mushrooms. Cut two mild capsicums into
strips.</p>

<p>Spread the onion on the chicken-turbot; put the tomatoes
and the sliced mushrooms on top, and upon these arrange the
grilled strips of mild capsicum. Besprinkle moderately with raspings;
lay one oz. of butter, cut into small pieces, on the top,
and set to cook gently in the oven.</p>

<p><a id="png.331" href="#png.331"><span class="pagenum"><span

three oz. of minced mushrooms.</p>

<p>Cut the chicken-turbot in the back, and partly separate the
fillets from the bone; lay it on the tray, and moisten with one-third

gently in the oven, and baste frequently the while.</p>

<p>When the chicken-turbot is cooked, dish it and keep it hot.
Pour the cooking-liquor into a sautépan; reduce it to half, and
add three tablespoonfuls of fish velouté and three oz. of butter.</p>

<p>My remarks relative to cold turbot apply here with even
greater force, for chicken-turbots are particularly well suited to
cold dishing.</p>

<p>The chicken-turbots to be served cold should not be too
small; the best for the purpose would be those weighing four lbs. or more.</p>

<p>In dismissing the subject I can but recommend cold chicken-turbot
as a dish admitting of the most tasteful arrangement and
decoration.</p>


<h3 title="Lobster (Homard)">LOBSTER (HOMARD)</h3>

<p>Whereas the ordinary lobster is a very favourite dish with
English gourmets, the spiny kind has scarcely any vogue. This
is no doubt accounted for by the fact that the former is not
only very plentiful, but also of excellent quality, while the
latter is comparatively scarce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="939—Homard à l’Américaine"><a id="rcp.939"
 >939—HOMARD <span class="nw">A L’AMÉRICAINE</span></a></h3>

<p>The first essential condition is that the lobster should be
alive. Sever and slightly crush the claws, with the view of
withdrawing their meat after cooking; cut the tail into sections;
split the carapace in two lengthwise, and remove the queen (a
little bag near the head containing some gravel). Put aside, on
a plate, the intestines and the coral, which will be used in the
finishing of the sauce, and season the pieces of lobster with
salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Put these pieces into a sautépan containing one-sixth pint
of oil and one oz. of butter, both very hot. Fry them over
an open fire until the meat has stiffened well and the carapace is
of a fine red colour.</p>

<p>Then remove all grease by tilting the sautépan on its side
with its lid on; sprinkle the pieces of lobster with two chopped
shallots and one crushed clove of garlic; add one-third pint of
white wine, one-quarter pint of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, a small glassful of
burnt brandy, one tablespoonful of melted meat-glaze, three
small, fresh, pressed, and chopped tomatoes (or, failing fresh
tomatoes, two tablespoonfuls of tomato purée), a pinch of <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i>
parsley, and a very little cayenne. Cover the sautépan,
and set to cook in the oven for eighteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p><a id="png.335" href="#png.335"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>317<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This done, transfer the pieces of lobster to a dish; withdraw
the meat from the section of the tail and the claws, and put
them in a timbale; set upright thereon the two halves of the
carapace, and let them lie against each other. Keep the whole
hot.</p>

<p>Now reduce the cooking-sauce of the lobster to one-third
pint; add thereto the intestines and the chopped coral, together
with a piece of butter the size of a walnut; set to cook for a
moment, and pass through a strainer.</p>

<p>Put this cullis into a vegetable-pan; heat it without letting
it boil, and add, away from the fire, three oz. of butter cut into
small pieces.</p>

<p>Pour this sauce over the pieces of lobster which have been
kept hot, and sprinkle the whole with a pinch of <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> and
scalded parsley.</p>

<p>Section the live lobster as directed above.</p>

<p>Stiffen the meat and colour the carapace in a sautépan with
two oz. of clarified butter. When the meat is quite stiff and
the carapace is red, pour away two-thirds of the butter. Then
add two tablespoonfuls of chopped shallots, a crushed piece
of garlic the size of a pea, one-sixth pint of white wine, three
tablespoonfuls of burnt brandy, and reduce the whole to half.
Complete with one-half pint of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, one-third pint of
maigre Espagnole, one-quarter pint of tomato sauce, one small
faggot, one pinch of salt, and a very little cayenne.</p>

<p>Put the lid on, and set to cook for one-quarter hour.</p>

<p>Take the meat from the sections of the tail and the claws, as
in the case of the preparation à l’américaine; put these into
a small sautépan, and keep them hot. Add the intestines and
the chopped coral, reduce the sauce to one-third pint; pass it
through a strainer, and pour it over the pieces of lobster.</p>

<p>Heat the whole without boiling; add a few drops of lemon
juice, two and one-half oz. of butter cut into small pieces, and
one-half tablespoonful of chopped chervil and tarragon, and
stir over the stove with the view of thoroughly mixing the
whole.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="943—Homard Cardinal"><a id="rcp.943"
 >943—HOMARD CARDINAL</a></h3>

<p>Plunge the live lobster into boiling <i>court-bouillon</i>, and cook
it after the manner directed under “Homard à la Hollandaise”
(No. <a href="#rcp.941">941</a>).</p>

<p>The moment it is cooked, cut it in two lengthwise; withdraw
the meat from the tail, slice it, and keep it hot in a little Cardinal
sauce. Disconnect the claws; open them sideways, and withdraw
all their meat without breaking them. Cut the withdrawn
meat into dice, as also the creamy parts from the carapace, and
add thereto their weight of cooked mushrooms and half that
quantity of truffles—both of which products should also be in
dice. Thicken this <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> with a few tablespoonfuls of lobster
sauce, and spread it in even layers on the bottom of each half-carapace.</p>

<p>Reserve, however, two tablespoonfuls of it for garnishing
the emptied claws.</p>

<p>Upon the <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> lay the slices of lobster, kept hot, alternating
these with fine slices of truffles. Set the two half-carapaces,
thus garnished, on a dish, and wedge them upright
by means of the two claws.</p>

<p>Coat the slices and the claws with Cardinal sauce; sprinkle
with grated cheese and melted butter; set to glaze quickly in a
fierce oven or at the salamander, and serve instantly.</p>

<p>Cook the lobster in <i>court-bouillon</i>, and drain it as soon as
it is done.</p>

<p>When it is only lukewarm, split it open lengthwise; take
the meat from the tail; slice it, and keep it hot in a vegetable-pan
with a few drops of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> or the cooking-liquor of
mushrooms.</p>

<p>Remove the remains of meat and the creamy parts from the
carapace; pound the two former together with two tablespoonfuls
of cream; strain through a fine sieve, and add to the resulting
cullis one-half pint of Béchamel sauce with curry.</p>

<p>Garnish the two half-carapaces, two-thirds full, with rice
à l’Indienne; set the slices of lobster on this rice, intercalating
them with slices of truffle; coat thinly with the prepared
Béchamel sauce, and set the two garnished and sauced half-carapaces
on a long, hot dish.</p>

<p>Send to the table, at the same time, a sauceboat containing
Béchamel with curry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="945—Homard à la Crème"><a id="rcp.945"

<p>Proceed as for “Homard à la New-burg à cru” (No. <a href="#rcp.948">948</a>),
but swill with brandy only, and add, immediately, four oz. of
fresh, peeled truffles cut into slices.</p>

<p>Moisten, almost sufficiently to cover, with very fresh, thin
cream; season with salt and cayenne, and cook the lobster.
Then take the meat from the carapaces, and put it into a
timbale; reduce the cream to one-third pint, and mix therewith
three tablespoonfuls of melted, white meat-glaze and a few drops
of lemon juice.</p>

<p>Strain this sauce through muslin, and pour it over the
pieces of lobster.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="946—Homard Grillé"><a id="rcp.946"
 >946—HOMARD GRILLÉ<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>For this purpose, the lobster may be taken raw, but it is
better, first, to have it three-parts cooked in <i>court-bouillon</i>.</p>

<p>Now split it into two lengthwise; sprinkle it with melted
butter, and set it on the grill for its cooking to be completed.</p>

<p>Treated thus, the meat of the lobster does not harden as
when it is grilled raw. Dish the grilled lobster on a napkin
or on a drainer, after having broken the shell of the claws in
order to facilitate the withdrawal of the meat, and surround with
curled-leaf parsley.</p>

<p>Serve a “Devilled sauce Escoffier,” or any other sauce
suited to grilled fish, with the lobster, but remember that the
first-named sauce is the fittest that could be found for this
particular dish.</p>

<h3 class="subhead" title="Homard à la New-burg">Homard à la New-burg</h3>

<p>This dish may be prepared in two ways—with raw lobster

 >948—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA NEW-BURG</span> (with raw lobster)</a></h3>

<p>Cut up the live lobster, and fry it in oil and butter as explained
under “<a href="#rcp.939">Homard à l’Américaine</a>.” When the pieces
of lobster are stiffened and coloured, clear them of all grease;
swill the sautépan with one tablespoonful of burnt brandy and
one-half pint of Marsala.</p>

<p>Reduce by a third; season, and add two-thirds pint of cream
and one-sixth pint of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. Cover and set to cook for
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Take out the pieces of lobster; withdraw the meat therefrom,
and keep it hot in a covered timbale. Thicken the sauce
with the reserved intestines and coral of the lobster, which
should be chopped in combination with one oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Set to boil a second time; rub the sauce through tammy, and
pour it over the pieces of lobster.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="949—Homard à la New-burg (with the lobster cooked)"><a id="rcp.949"
 >949—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA NEW-BURG</span> (with the lobster cooked)</a></h3>

<p>Cook the lobster in <i>court-bouillon</i>. Remove the shell from
the tail; take the meat therefrom, and cut it into regular slices.
Lay these slices in a liberally-buttered sautépan, season
strongly, and heat the slices on both sides until the outside
membrane acquires a fine red colour.</p>

<p>Moisten with enough Madeira to almost cover the slices, and
reduce the moistening almost entirely. When dishing up, pour
a leason, composed of one and one-quarter pints of cream and
two egg-yolks, over the slices. Stir gently on the side of the
fire until the thickening has been effected by the cooking of the
egg-yolks, and serve in a lukewarm timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="950—Homard à la Palestine"><a id="rcp.950"
 >950—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA PALESTINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut up the live lobster and toss it in butter with a <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>
prepared in advance, as for crayfish intended for potage bisque.</p>

<p>Moisten with two-thirds pint of white wine, one pint of

 class="ns">[</span>321<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->, and three tablespoonfuls of burnt brandy. Cover
and cook for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Now detach the sections of the tail and the claws; withdraw
the meat from them, and keep them hot in a small covered
saucepan with a little butter. Pound the carapace and remains
of the lobster in a mortar; fry them in four tablespoonfuls of
very hot oil, and add thereto an ordinary <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, cut very
fine. Moisten with the cooking-liquor of the lobster, and set
to cook for one-quarter hour. Strain through muslin; leave
to stand for five minutes, that the oil may rise to the surface,
and then completely remove it. Reduce this liquid to one-quarter
pint; thicken it with the reserved creamy parts of the
lobster, rubbed through tammy, and two tablespoonfuls of
fish velouté, and finish this sauce with two and one-half oz.
of curry butter.</p>

<p>Arrange a border of pilaff rice (No. <a href="#rcp.2255">2255</a>) on the dish
intended for the lobster; set the pieces of lobster, kept hot, in
the centre, and coat these with a few tablespoonfuls of curry
sauce.</p>

<p>Serve the remainder of the sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="951—Mousselines de Homard"><a id="rcp.951"
 >951—MOUSSELINES DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>In the matter of crustaceans, the term <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> stands, as a
rule, for a cold preparation, whereas the term <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> is
only applied to warm dishes. The special <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> or
quenelles of lobster are made with a <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat, the
recipe for which I gave under No. <a href="#rcp.195">195</a>. This forcemeat is prepared
with the raw meat of the lobster.</p>

<p>As with the other crustaceans, their meat produces forcemeat
which is somewhat too flimsy to be spoon-moulded, and it is
preferable to poach it in special well-buttered quenelle- or
<i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousselines</a></i> are poached under cover in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>All the garnishes and sauces given in respect of salmon
<i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> may be applied here. The reader will therefore

<h3 class="recipe" title="952—Soufflés de Homard"><a id="rcp.952"
 >952—SOUFFLÉS DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>For lobster <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i> the same forcemeat is used as for the
<i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>; but, unlike the latter, it is poached in the half-carapaces
of the lobster, the meat of which has served in its
preparation. The procedure is as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>First cook the
two half-carapaces carefully, that they may not lose their
shape in the process.</p>

<p><a id="png.340" href="#png.340"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>322<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>After having drained and dried them, fill them with <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i>
forcemeat and surround them with strong, buttered paper,
which should be tied on with string, and should overreach the
edges of the carapaces by one inch.</p>

<p>The object of this measure is to prevent the forcemeat from
spilling during the poaching.</p>

<p>Lay the two garnished carapaces on a tray containing just
enough boiling water to moisten its whole surface. Put the
tray in a moderate oven or in a steamer, and allow from fifteen
to twenty minutes for the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> to poach.</p>

<p>This done, carefully drain the two carapaces; remove the
paper holding in the forcemeat; dish them on a napkin, and
surround them with bunches of very green, curled-leaf parsley.
Serve separately a sauce in keeping with the preparation; <i>i.e.</i>, a
Normande, a White-wine, a Diplomate, or a Béchamel finished
with lobster butter, &amp;c.</p>

<p>N.B.—The above constitutes the model-recipe of lobster
<i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i>, and I need scarcely point out that the latter may be
varied almost indefinitely in accordance with the fancy of the
cook and the taste of the consumer.</p>

<p>Thus the forcemeat may be garnished with truffles in dice,
slices of lobster, milt, or poached oysters, &amp;c., which garnishes
may also be laid on the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> when it is finished. I therefore
leave to the operator, who should now see his way quite
clearly, the task of imagining the various possible combinations,
a description of which would but unnecessarily delay the progress
of this work.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="953—Cold Lobster with Various Sauces"><a id="rcp.953"
 >953—COLD LOBSTER WITH VARIOUS SAUCES</a></h3>

<p>Cook the lobster in <i>court-bouillon</i>, and let it cool in the
latter. Drain it, sever the claws, and break them open in order
to withdraw their meat. Split the lobster into two lengthwise,
remove the intestines and the queen, and dish it on a napkin.
Lay the claws on either side of it, and surround it either with
curled-leaf parsley or with a few hearts of lettuce.</p>

<p>Send to the table separately one of the derivative sauces of
the Mayonnaise (Nos. <a href="#rcp.122">122</a> to <a href="#rcp.132">132</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="954—Aspic de Homard"><a id="rcp.954"
 >954—ASPIC DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>Under “Aspic de filets de soles” (No. <a href="#rcp.915">915</a>), I pointed out
the preparatory principles of an aspic; in this case, therefore,
I shall only refer to the various details very cursorily.</p>

<p>Let a thin coating of white fish jelly set on the bottom of
an aspic-mould incrusted in ice. The reader is reminded of
the great care that must be observed in the preparation of an
<a id="png.341" href="#png.341"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>323<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>aspic jelly, that the latter be limpid, succulent, and just sufficiently
firm not to break when withdrawn from the mould.
Decorate the bottom of the mould with bits of truffle, poached
white of egg, lobster coral, capers, and tarragon leaves.</p>

<p>The decorative design cannot be described; it must be left
to the taste and fancy of the operator; all I can urge is that
it be as regular and symmetrical as possible.</p>

<p>Fix the decoration by means of a few drops of jelly; then
cover the whole with a thickness of one inch of the same jelly,
and leave the latter to set. Upon this layer of jelly arrange
rows of thin slices of lobster meat and slices of truffles placed
alternately and slightly overlapping. Now add enough jelly
to cover these slices, and continue filling up the mould with
varying layers consisting respectively of jelly (one inch thick)
and the slices above described.</p>

<p>When about to serve, dip the mould in hot water; dry it,
and turn out the aspic upon a dish covered with a napkin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="955—Côtelettes de Homard Arkangel"><a id="rcp.955"
 >955—CÔTELETTES DE HOMARD ARKANGEL</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of lobster meat in dice combined with
its weight of caviare, the whole quantity being in proportion
to the number of <i>côtelettes</i> required.</p>

<p>Thicken the <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> with an equal quantity of lobster
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> (No. <a href="#rcp.956">956</a>), and at once garnish some moderately oiled
cutlet-moulds with the preparation. As soon as the latter has
set, turn out the cutlets; coat them with a fish chaud-froid
sauce, finished with lobster butter; and deck each with a fine,
grooved slice of truffle. Glaze them with cold melted jelly,
and keep them in the cool until required to be served.</p>

<p>Arrange them in a circle on a round dish; garnish the centre
with chopped white jelly, and serve a Russian salad separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="956—Mousse de Homard"><a id="rcp.956"
 >956—MOUSSE DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>Cook the lobster in a few tablespoonfuls of previously-prepared
fine <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, one half-bottle of white wine, and a
small glass of burnt brandy. Leave to cool in the cooking-liquor.
Now split the lobster in two, with the view of withdrawing
its meat. Finely pound the latter while adding thereto,
little by little, one-third pint of cold fish velouté per lb. of
meat. Rub through a sieve; put the resulting purée in a
vegetable-pan lying on ice, and stir for a few minutes. This
done, add a little good fish jelly, melted and cold, and one-third
pint of barely-whipped cream. Taste; rectify the seasoning,
and warm it slightly with cayenne.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="957—Mousse de Homard Moulée"><a id="png.342" href="#png.342"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.957"
 >957—MOUSSE DE HOMARD MOULÉE</a></h3>

<p>When the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> is intended for moulding, it is well to
decorate and “<a href="#g_clothe">clothe</a>” the mould with fish jelly some time in
advance. I have already explained that to “<a href="#g_clothe">clothe</a>” a mould
with jelly, all that is needed is to pour therein a few tablespoonfuls
of melted jelly, and then to rock the utensil on
ice. By this means a thin even coating sets on the bottom
and sides of the mould, which, when the moulding is turned
out, swathes the latter in a transparent film.</p>

<p>This “<a href="#g_clothe">clothing</a>” of jelly may be made more or less thick,
according to the requirements, by simply using more or less
jelly, and by proportionately lengthening or shortening the
time for rocking the mould.</p>

<p>When the mould is <a href="#g_clothe">clothed</a>, decorate the sides with large
slices of very black truffle dipped in melted jelly, that they
may stick.</p>

<p>This done, fill the receptacle with the prepared <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> (see
the preceding recipe), and leave to set in the cool.</p>

<p>For the turning out of the mould and the dishing of the
moulding, proceed as for the aspic.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="958—Petites Mousses de Homard"><a id="rcp.958"
 >958—PETITES MOUSSES DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>For these small <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>, use little <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> or silver timbales.
First let a thin layer of jelly (one or two tablespoonfuls,
according to their size) set on the bottom of each utensil,
and then surround the latter with bands of white paper, the ends
of which should be stuck together, and should reach one inch
above the brims of the <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i>. The preparation of <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>
may now be placed in the <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> in a sufficient quantity
to overflow the brims, so that, when the paper is removed,
their appearance is that of small <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i>.</p>

<p>When the <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> have been garnished, put them aside
on ice or in a refrigerator until they are served.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="959—Homard à la Grammont"><a id="rcp.959"
 >959—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA GRAMMONT</span></a></h3>

<p>Split the lobster open lengthwise down the middle. Withdraw
the meat from the tail; trim it, and cut it into regular
collops. Coat the latter again and again with aspic jelly, that
they may be well covered with it; decorate each with a slice of
truffle, and glaze it with the same aspic.</p>

<p>Also coat with jelly as many very white poached and dried
oysters as there are collops.</p>

<p>Now take the creamy parts and the meat of the claws, and
pound them finely with one tablespoonful of cold Béchamel
<a id="png.343" href="#png.343"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>325<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sauce; rub through a sieve, and, with the resulting purée combined
with melted fish jelly and cream (see lobster mousse No. <a href="#rcp.956">956</a>), prepare a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> “au paprika” of a decided pink colour.</p>

<p>Fill the two half-carapaces to their edges with this <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>,
and leave it to set on ice.</p>

<p>When about to serve, lay the collops, glazed with jelly, upon
this <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, and place an oyster between each pair. Dish the
two garnished half-carapaces, back to back, upon a napkin,
and put the heart of a lettuce in the middle, and a bunch of
curled-leaf parsley at either end.</p>

<p>Serve a mayonnaise or other cold sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="960—Homard à la Parisienne"><a id="rcp.960"
 >960—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA PARISIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Tie a lobster to a little board; stretch out its tail to the
fullest extent; cook it in <i>court-bouillon</i>, and leave it to cool in
the latter.</p>

<p>When it is quite cold, with the help of scissors, carefully
cut a strip of the shell from the back of the head to the tail.
The aperture left by the removed strip of shell ought to be
sufficiently wide to allow of the meat of the tail being removed
without breaking it. Having emptied the tail, refill it with
salad leaves, and return the strip of shell (upside down) to its
place. Cut the meat of the tail into even collops, and lay on
each a roundel of truffle stamped out with the fancy-cutter, and
dipped in half-melted jelly. Then coat these slices, which
should be on a dish, again and again, with cold melted jelly
until they are well covered with it.</p>

<p>Now break the claws and remove their meat, as also that
remaining in the carapace, and cut both meats into dice. Take
the creamy parts, and rub them through a sieve.</p>

<p>Prepare a small vegetable salad; add thereto the meat dice,
and cohere the two with a mayonnaise sauce combined with
melted jelly and the creamy parts rubbed through a sieve.
When the salad begins to set, owing to the jelly contained in
the mayonnaise, garnish twelve small artichoke-bottoms with
it, arranging the salad in them in pyramid form. Set a bit of
truffle on each pyramid, and sprinkle the salad with melted
fish jelly in order to make it glossy.</p>

<p><i>Dishing.</i>—Dish the lobster on a cushion of buttered bread
on which a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of lettuce has been stuck, or on one of
carved rice. The cushion should have the shape of a wedge,
in order that the lobster may lie at an angle of about 45°, with
its head raised, when laid upon it. Arrange the slices (slightly
overlapping one another) along the back of the lobster,
<a id="png.344" href="#png.344"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>326<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beginning at its head with the smallest of them, and progressing
down towards the tail, gradually increasing their size.</p>

<p>Surround the lobster alternately with artichoke-bottoms garnished
with salad, and quartered hard-boiled eggs, or halved
hard-boiled eggs (set upright with their yolks facing outwards).</p>

<p>Border the dish with very clear jelly in large cubes or
triangles, etc.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="961—Homard à la Russe"><a id="rcp.961"
 >961—HOMARD <span class="nw">A LA RUSSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as above with regard to the cooking of the
lobster, the extraction of the meat, and the cutting of it into
slices. Coat the slices with mayonnaise sauce combined with
melted jelly; or, better still, with a white fish chaud-froid
sauce combined with the lobster’s creamy parts rubbed through
a sieve.</p>

<p>Decorate each slice with a bit of coral and two little chervil
leaves; coat them again and again with cold melted aspic, and
put them aside in the cool. “<i><a href="#g_clothe">Clothe</a></i>” ten <i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>, and
decorate the bottom of each with a slice of truffle. Also prepare
ten hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>Prepare a Salade Russe (without meat); add to this the
remains of the lobster meat cut into dice, and thicken with
mayonnaise and melted aspic, mixed. With this thickened salad
fill the <i><a href="#g_dariole">dariole-moulds</a></i>, and leave to set in the cool.</p>

<p><i>Dishing.</i>—Set the lobster on a cushion, after the manner of
the preceding recipe. Trim the slices, and lay them, as before,
on the lobster’s back, taking care to graduate their sizes. Surround
the lobster with the small moulded salads, and alternate
these with the hard-boiled eggs. The latter should be cut in
two at a point one-third of their height above their base; their
yolks should be removed, the space filled with caviare moulded
to the form of a pyramid, and, this done, the eggs should be
set upright.</p>

<p>Border the dish with roundels of very clear fish jelly, stamped
out by a fancy-cutter, and lay a bit of truffle upon each.</p>

<p>N.B.—(1) The moulds of salad must, of course, be dipped
in hot water before being turned out.</p>

<p>(2) The lobster may also be served “à la Néva,” “à la
Moscovite,” “à la Sibérienne,” &amp;c., but these preparations are
only minor forms of “Homard à la Russe” under different
names.</p>

<p>Changes may be effected in the preparation by altering the
constituents of the salad and its dishing. It may, for instance,
be made in small cucumber or beetroot <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>, while the
caviare, instead of being laid in hard-boiled eggs, may be served
in little pleated cases.</p>

<p><a id="png.345" href="#png.345"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>327<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>As these preparations, however, are based neither on fixed
principles nor on classical rules, I shall refrain from giving
them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="962—Mayonnaise de Homard"><a id="rcp.962"
 >962—MAYONNAISE DE HOMARD</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as for Mayonnaise de Saumon—that is to say, garnish
the bottom of a salad-bowl with <i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i> lettuce leaves, and
season them moderately.</p>

<p>Upon this salad lay the remains of the lobster, and upon
the latter place the thin slices of the tail. Cover with mayonnaise
sauce, and decorate with strips of anchovy fillets, capers,
olives, hard-boiled eggs, roundels of pink radishes, the hearts of
lettuce, &amp;c.</p>

<p>N.B.—I have already pointed out the futility of prescribing

<h3 class="subhead" title="Crayfish (Écrevisses)">Crayfish. (Écrevisses.)</h3>

<p>When crayfish are prepared after one of the recipes most
commonly used on the Continent, <i>i.e.</i>, whole, they are not much
relished in England. This is doubtless accounted for by the
fact that ladies, dining in evening dress, find them somewhat
difficult to manage.</p>

<p>They are therefore only served in the form of an aspic, a
<a id="png.346" href="#png.346"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>328<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>, timbales, &amp;c., or as the garnish of some
other fish; for in all these cases they are shelled.</p>

<p>Be all this as it may, I give below the various recipes relating
to them, and from among these it ought to be possible to
choose one which will meet the requirements of any particular
case.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="966—Écrevisses à la Bordelaise"><a id="rcp.966"
 >966—ÉCREVISSES <span class="nw">A LA BORDELAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>N.B.—Whatever be their mode of preparation, crayfish
should always be thoroughly cleansed and cleared of their intestines,
the extreme end of which is to be found under the
middle of the tail. In order to remove the intestines, take the
telson or tail-segment between the point of a small knife and
the thumb, and pull gently. If this were not done, the intestines,
especially in the breeding season, might render the
crayfish disagreeably bitter.</p>

<p>As soon as their intestines have been removed, the crayfish
should be set to cook, otherwise, <i>i.e.</i>, if they be left to wait,
their juices escape through the anal wound, and they empty.</p>

<p>For twelve crayfish, after having cleaned and eviscerated
them, put them into a vegetable-pan with one tablespoonful
of very fine <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, completely cooked beforehand, and two-thirds oz. of butter. Toss them over an open fire until the
shells have acquired a fine, red colour. Moisten with three
tablespoonfuls of burnt brandy and one-quarter pint of white
wine; reduce by a third, and complete with one tablespoonful
of Espagnole, two tablespoonfuls of fish <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, the same quantity
of tomato purée, and one spoonful of special <i>mirepoix</i>
(No. <a href="#rcp.229">229</a>).</p>

<p>Put the lid on, and set to cook for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Dish the crayfish in a timbale; reduce the sauce by a quarter,
and finish it with a few drops of meat glaze, one oz. of butter,
a very little cayenne, chopped chervil, and tarragon. Pour
this over the crayfish, and serve instantly.</p>

<p>In the case of twelve crayfish, toss them in two-thirds oz. of
butter over an open fire, until the shells are of a fine red. Season
with salt and pepper; add two finely chopped shallots, a bit
of thyme and a bit of bay; moisten with one-third pint of
white wine; cover; cook for ten minutes, and dish in a timbale.</p>

<p>Reduce the cooking-liquor to half; thicken with two tablespoonfuls

treatment; (2) toss sixty crayfish in butter with two
tablespoonfuls of very fine <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> cooked in butter beforehand.
When the crayfish are of a distinct red, moisten with
one glass of white wine and three tablespoonfuls of burned
brandy; season with salt and cayenne pepper; cover them, and
keep them on the side of the fire for ten minutes, taking care to
toss them again from time to time; (3) shell the tails and put
them into a small saucepan with twenty small quenelles
of whiting forcemeat, finished with crayfish butter; fifteen
small, grooved mushrooms, cooked and very white, and three oz. of truffles in slices. Add a few drops of the mushroom cooking-liquor
to this garnish, and keep it hot; (4) pound the
remains and carcasses of the crayfish very finely; add two-thirds
pint of cream sauce to the resulting purée; rub it through

<p>Cook twelve fine crayfish in accordance with the directions
under No. <a href="#rcp.966">966</a>, but substitute champagne for the white wine.</p>

<p>Shell the tails; trim them evenly; cut them in two lengthwise,
and keep them in the cool until they are wanted. Remove
the creamy parts from the carapaces of the crayfish; add the
trimmings of the tails, the meat from the claws, and the
<i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> in which the crayfish have cooked.</p>

<p>Pound the whole very finely in a mortar, and rub it through
a sieve. Put the resulting purée in a receptacle; add thereto
one-quarter pint of very cold, melted aspic, and three tablespoonfuls
of barely beaten cream. Leave this preparation to
settle.</p>

<p>Trim the crayfish carapaces; fill them with a little prepared
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, and decorate each carapace with a small roundel of
truffle.</p>

<p>Put the remainder of the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> in the middle of a little
crystal bowl, and mould it to the shape of a cone, narrow towards
the base, and as high as possible.</p>

<p>Arrange the garnished crayfish carapaces on their backs in
the bowl around the cone of <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, and set some crayfish
tails in superposed rings up the cone. The crayfish tails should
<a id="png.349" href="#png.349"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>331<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be dipped in half-melted jelly, that they may stick fast to the
cone. Lay a small, very round truffle on the top of the cone
to complete the decoration. This done, coat the whole again
and again by means of a spoon with half-melted, succulent,
clear fish jelly, and incrust the timbale in a block of ice, or set
it amidst the latter broken up.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="976—Mousse d’Écrevisses"><a id="rcp.976"
 >976—MOUSSE D’ÉCREVISSES</a></h3>

<p>For ten people cook thirty crayfish as for potage Bisque.
This done, remove the tails, and reserve a dozen fine carapaces.
Finely pound the remainder, together with the <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> in
which the crayfish have cooked, and add thereto one-half oz.
of butter, one oz. of red butter (No. <a href="#rcp.142">142</a>), one-quarter pint of
cold fish velouté, and six tablespoonfuls of melted fish jelly.
Rub through tammy, and put the resulting purée in a saucepan;
stir it over ice for two or three minutes; add three-quarters
pint of half-beaten cream, and the crayfish tails cut into dice
or finely sliced.</p>

<p>Before beginning to prepare the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, line the bottom and
side of a <i>Charlotte-mould</i> with paper, that the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> may be
moulded as soon as ready.</p>

<p>Pour the preparation into the mould, taking care to reserve
enough for the twelve carapaces already put aside, and put the
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> on ice or in a refrigerator until dishing it. Fill the
twelve trimmed carapaces with the reserved <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, and decorate
each with a round slice of truffle. When about to serve, turn
out the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> on a small, round cushion of semolina or rice,
one-half inch thick, lying on a dish. Remove all the paper,
and decorate the top of the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> with a crown of fine slices
of truffle dipped in melted jelly, that they may be glossy.</p>

<p>Surround the semolina or rice cushion with a border of
chopped jelly, and arrange the garnished carapaces upon this
jelly, setting them almost upright.</p>

<p>N.B.—(1) Instead of being served on a cushion, the crayfish
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> may be sent to the table in a deep silver dish with a
border of chopped jelly, and surrounded by the garnished
carapaces. The utensil is then laid on a flat dish in a bed of
broken ice, or it is incrusted direct in a block of carved ice.</p>

<p>(2) For the moulding of crayfish <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, the mould may be
“<i><a href="#g_clothe">clothed</a></i>” with fish jelly and decorated with slices of truffle,
as directed under “Mousse de Homard moulée” (No. <a href="#rcp.957">957</a>).</p>

<p>A <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> prepared in this way may be either dished on a
semolina or rice cushion, or in a deep silver entrée dish, as
described above.</p>

<p>Select forty medium-sized crayfish that seem full of life;
cook them quickly in a highly-seasoned <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i>, moistened
with one half-bottle of dry champagne. This done, shell them;
trim their tails, and keep them in the cool in a small bowl.
Pound their shells as finely as possible with one-quarter lb.
of fresh butter, and put the resulting purée in a saucepan,
together with one-half pint of boiling velouté containing four
or five leaves of gelatine, and the cooking-liquor of the crayfish
passed through a fine strainer.</p>

<p>Set to boil for a few minutes, that the remains may exude
all their flavour; rub through tammy over a basin lying on
ice, and whisk the preparation in order to accelerate its cooling.
As soon as it begins to thicken, add one pint of half-whipped
cream to it. Then pour the whole into a silver or
porcelain timbale, taking care that the utensil be not more
than three-quarters full.</p>

<p>When the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> has set, decorate the surface with the
reserved crayfish tails, to which are added, as a finish, bits
of truffle and chervil leaves. Cover the decoration with a thin
coating of easily-melting and amber-coloured fish jelly, and
put the timbale on ice. When about to serve, incrust it in a
block of carved ice, or place it on a silver dish with broken ice
all round.</p>

take forty instead of thirty. Shell the tails; trim them and cut
them into dice. Prepare the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> in the same way, but use
twice as much red butter. Garnish twelve carapaces after the
same manner, and decorate each with a slice of truffle.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_clothe">Clothe</a></i> a dome- or Charlotte-mould somewhat thickly with
jelly; garnish its bottom and sides with crayfish tails, previously
dipped in half-melted jelly, and arranged in superposed
rows; and place the crayfish so that the tails of the first row
lie to the left, those of the second row to the right, and
so on. As often as possible, do this work before preparing
the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, in order that the latter may be put into the mould
as soon as ready.</p>

<p>When about to fill the mould, add twenty fine slices of
truffle to the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>. Dish after one of the two methods
directed in the appended note to No. <a href="#rcp.970">970</a>, and take care to dip

<p>For the moulding of these small <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i> I can only repeat
what I said under “Petites Mousses de Homard” (No. <a href="#rcp.958">958</a>).
Let a thin coating of jelly set on the bottom of the small
<i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> or timbales used; garnish their insides with a band
of white paper, reaching one inch above their brims; stick the
end of this band with a little batter.</p>

<p>Now garnish the timbales with <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, letting it project
above their edges to the extent of two-thirds of an inch, and leave
it to set in the cool. When about to serve, remove the band of
paper, holding in the projecting <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, and the appearance
of the garnished timbales is exactly that of small, hot <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i>.

<h3 class="recipe" title="989—Bloaters"><a id="rcp.989"
 >989—BLOATERS</a></h3>

<p>Bloaters, or herrings partially dried in smoke, form one of
the nicest breakfast dishes. As a rule, they are simply grilled
over a moderate fire. It should be borne in mind that, as these
fish are only partially salted and smoked, they will not keep
very long.</p>


<h3 title="Cod (Cabillaud)">COD. (CABILLAUD.)</h3>

<p>If cod were less common, it would be held in as high esteem
as salmon; for, when it is really fresh and of good quality, the
delicacy and delicious flavour of its flesh admit of its ranking
among the finest of fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="990—Cabillaud Bouilli"><a id="rcp.990"
 >990—CABILLAUD BOUILLI</a></h3>

<p>Fresh cod is mostly served boiled, either whole, in sections,
or in <i><a href="#g_darne">darnes</a></i>, and the directions given under “The Boiling of
Fish” (No. <a href="#rcp.776">776</a>) apply particularly to this fish.</p>

<p>Boiled fresh cod is always accompanied by its liver, poached
in salted water, and very floury potatoes, boiled at the last
minute, must always be sent to the table with it.</p>

<p>Served thus with an oyster sauce, a Hollandaise sauce, or
<a id="png.354" href="#png.354"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>336<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>melted butter, fresh cod constitutes a Relevé which would satisfy
the most exacting of gourmets.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="991—Cabillaud Grillé"><a id="rcp.991"
 >991—CABILLAUD GRILLÉ</a></h3>

<p>Cut the fish into slices one inch or two inches thick. Season
these slices; dredge them; sprinkle them copiously with
melted butter, and set them to grill, remembering to baste
them frequently the while with melted butter.</p>

<p>Serve them on a hot dish; garnish them with slices of lemon,
and surround with bunches of parsley.</p>

<p>Send a Maître-d’Hôtel or Anchovy butter, or a grilled-fish
sauce to the table with the dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="992—Cabillaud Frit"><a id="rcp.992"
 >992—CABILLAUD FRIT</a></h3>

<p>Cut some slices of fresh cod, from one inch to one and one-half
inches thick. Season them, treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and
fry them sufficiently to allow of their being well cooked all
through. Dish them on a napkin with fried parsley and lemon,
and send a butter sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.66">66</a>), a tartare sauce, or a tomato
sauce to the table at the same time as the fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="993—Cabillaud Crème Gratin"><a id="rcp.993"
 >993—CABILLAUD CRÈME GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>For ten people take two lbs. of boiled fresh cod divided
into small pieces; clear these of all bones and skin, and keep
them hot in a little of their cooking-liquor.</p>

<p>Now, with the necessary quantity of Duchesse potatoes (No. <a href="#rcp.221">221</a>), and by means of a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe,
lay a border, one and one-half inches high, round a dish, shaping
it in such wise that it is thickest at its base. The dish may
be either round or oval. Carefully <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> this border with egg-yolks.</p>

<p>This done, pour a few tablespoonfuls of Mornay sauce on
the dish; lay thereon the drained pieces of cod, and cover the
latter with enough Mornay sauce to reach within one-third of an
inch of the brim of the border. If more sauce were used, it
would flow over the border during the process of glazing.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and melted butter; set to
glaze, and see that the border gets evenly coloured.</p>

<p>Serve the moment the dish is withdrawn from the oven.</p>

<p>N.B.—This mode of preparation is not restricted to fresh
cod. It may be applied to all other boiled fish—turbot, chicken-turbot,
brill, bass, salmon, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="994—Cabillaud à la Flamande"><a id="rcp.994"
 >994—CABILLAUD <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut the fresh cod into slices one inch thick; season them with
salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and put them in a sautépan or a
<a id="png.355" href="#png.355"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>337<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>deep, liberally-buttered tray. Moisten with white wine to the
height of the slices; add chopped shallots and “fines herbes,”
and garnish the fish with roundels of pipped lemon, peeled to
the pulp.</p>

<p>Set to boil, and then poach in the oven for twelve minutes.
Place the slices on a dish; thicken their cooking-liquor with
crushed <a href="#g_biscottes"><i>biscotte</i></a>; cook it for five minutes; pour it over the
slices, and serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="995—Cabillaud à la Portugaise"><a id="rcp.995"
 >995—CABILLAUD <span class="nw">A LA PORTUGAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>For ten people, cut five slices of fresh cod, each weighing
one-half lb., and season them with salt and pepper. Put these
slices into a sautépan containing the following garnish, into
which they should be <span class="nw">pressed:—</span>Three oz. of butter and one-sixth
pint of oil; one large onion, chopped and lightly coloured
in butter; a bit of crushed garlic the size of a pea; one faggot;
two pinches of <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> parsley; eight medium-sized, peeled,
pressed, and minced tomatoes, and one-third pint of white wine.</p>

<p>Cover the sautépan, and set to boil on an open fire for five
minutes.</p>

<p>Now take the lid off the saucepan, and leave it to cook for
twelve minutes on the side of the fire, in order that the liquid
may be reduced and the fish cooked at the same moment of
time.</p>

<p>Set the slices on a long dish; withdraw the faggot, and pour
the garnish and the cooking-liquor over the fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="996—Laitances de Carpe (Carp’s Milt)"><a id="rcp.996"
 >996—LAITANCES DE CARPE (Carp’s Milt)</a></h3>

<p>The milt of a carp makes a very delicate dish. It is served
either as a second fish at a dinner; as a garnish to large fish
Relevés, after having been poached in salted water; or cut
while raw into slices which are generally treated <i>à la Meunière</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="997—Laitances à la Meunière"><a id="rcp.997"
 >997—LAITANCES <span class="nw">A LA MEUNIÈRE</span></a></h3>

<p>Prepare them whole or in collops, in pursuance of the directions
given under “The Cooking of Fish à la Meunière”
(No. <a href="#rcp.778">778</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="998—Barquettes de Laitances à la Florentine"><a id="rcp.998"
 >998—BARQUETTES DE LAITANCES <span class="nw">A LA FLORENTINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Poach the milts in salted water; cut them into small, long
slices, and set them in <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquette</i></a> crusts prepared in advance.</p>

<p>Cover the sliced milts with a soufflé au Parmesan (No. <a href="#rcp.2295a">2295a</a>), and shape the latter slightly after the manner of a dome.</p>

<p>Arrange the <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a> on a dish, and put them in a moderate
oven, that they may cook and the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> be glazed at the same
<a id="png.356" href="#png.356"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>338<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time. When taking them out of the oven, dish them on a
napkin and serve immediately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="999—Caisses de Laitances à la Nantua"><a id="rcp.999"
 >999—CAISSES DE LAITANCES <span class="nw">A LA NANTUA</span></a></h3>

<p>Poach the milts in salted water. Drain them, and cut them
into small slices thicker than their length.</p>

<p>Place these slices in small pleated porcelain cases with
two crayfish tails in each. Fill up the cases with Nantua sauce,
and lay a fine slice of truffle over the centre of each case.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1000—John Dory (St. Pierre)"><a id="rcp.1000"
 >1000—JOHN DORY (St. Pierre)</a></h3>

<p>This fish, which is in the highest degree unsightly, is possessed
of flesh whose firmness, whiteness, and delicacy are
of the rarest excellence; and, when quite fresh, its fillets are
certainly equal in quality to those of the chicken-turbot and
the sole.</p>

<p>Albeit the dory is not as popular as it deserves to be, and
this is owing either to its unsightliness, which may prejudice
the opinion of gourmets against it, to people’s indifference with
regard to it, or to a mere trick of fashion.</p>

<p>While I admit its unpopularity, however, I should strongly
recommend all lovers of fish to give it a trial. Let them prepare
the dory’s fillets after the recipes given under Fillets of Sole and
Chicken-turbot, and, provided the directions be properly carried
out, I venture to believe that the prevailing aversion to dory will
very soon be found to have no warrant in fact.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1001—Fresh Haddock (Eglefin)"><a id="rcp.1001"
 >1001—FRESH HADDOCK (Eglefin)</a></h3>

<p>This fish is chiefly eaten smoked, under the name of haddock.</p>

<p>When it is fresh, it may be prepared after the recipes given
for cod, to which it is quite equal in the matter of delicacy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1002—Smelt (Éperlans)"><a id="rcp.1002"
 >1002—SMELT (Éperlans)</a></h3>

<p>Owing to their small size, smelts only lend themselves to a
very limited number of preparations. They are usually served
either on little skewers or dished in a heap on a napkin, with
fried parsley and grooved half-lemons; those on skewers are
dished flat with the same garnish.</p>

<p>Large smelts may be treated after the recipes immediately
following.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1003—Éperlans à l’Anglaise"><a id="rcp.1003"
 >1003—ÉPERLANS <span class="nw">A L’ANGLAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Open the smelts down the back and carefully bone, without
disfiguring them. Treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> with fine bread-crumbs,
and pat them lightly with the flat of a knife, that the
bread-crumbs may adhere well.</p>

<p><a id="png.357" href="#png.357"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>339<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Cook them in clarified butter; set them on a long hot dish,
and besprinkle them with half-melted butter à la Maître-d’Hôtel
(No. <a href="#rcp.150">150</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1004—Éperlans au Gratin"><a id="rcp.1004"
 >1004—ÉPERLANS AU GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as for “Merlans au Gratin” (No. <a href="#rcp.1018">1018</a>), but allowing
for the difference between the sizes of the two fish, put the
smelts in a fiercer oven than the whiting, in order that they may
be cooked simultaneously with the formation of the <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1005—Éperlans Grillés"><a id="rcp.1005"
 >1005—ÉPERLANS GRILLÉS</a></h3>

<p>Open them down the back, and remove the bulk of their
spine, leaving a small piece only in the region of the tail, and
another small piece at the head. Season, dredge, and
sprinkle them with melted butter, and grill them quickly.</p>

<p>Set them on a long, hot dish; surround them with slices of
lemon and bunches of fried parsley, and serve separately either
some half-melted butter à la Maître-d’Hôtel, or a sauce suited
to grilled fish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1006—Mousselines d’Éperlans"><a id="rcp.1006"
 >1006—MOUSSELINES D’ÉPERLANS</a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as for Mousselines de Saumon (No. <a href="#rcp.797">797</a>).
To prepare the forcemeat, follow the directions under No. <a href="#rcp.195">195</a>;
but note the following <span class="nw">changes:—</span>Of the whole quantity of the
meat of fish, that of the smelt should only measure one-third;
the other two-thirds should be supplied by the sole, dory, or
whiting.</p>

<p>The object of this disproportion has already been explained
under “Velouté d’Éperlans” (No. <a href="#rcp.680">680</a>). The flesh of the smelt
is of a much too decided flavour to be used alone, and when
this flavour dominates, it becomes positively disagreeable; hence
the need of a fish whose flesh is almost neutral in so far as
taste is concerned. But this addition of a fish foreign to the
base of the preparation fulfils a double purpose; for, while it
effectually weakens the pungency of the smelt’s flesh, it also
enables the whole preparation to absorb a much larger quantity
of cream, and this last circumstance can only allow of the
<i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> being lighter and mellower.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1007—Mousse Chaude d’Éperlans à la Royale"><a id="rcp.1007"
 >1007—MOUSSE CHAUDE D’ÉPERLANS <span class="nw">A LA ROYALE</span></a></h3>

<p>Take a Charlotte-mould, of a size in proportion to the
number of people to be served, and butter its bottom and sides.
Cover the bottom of the mould with a round piece of buttered
kitchen paper, and do the same on the sides.</p>

<p>Prepare the required quantity of smelts’ fillets; slightly
flatten them in order to break their fibres, and trim them all to
the same length and width.</p>

<p><a id="png.358" href="#png.358"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>340<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Then garnish the bottom of the mould with the fillets of
smelt, placing them so that their skin-sides are against the
mould. Between each of the fillets set a small strip of truffle,
one quarter of the width of the former.</p>

<p>Garnish the sides in the same way, putting a strip of truffle
between each; but take care to place the fillets aslant instead
of upright. Having thus lined the mould with fillets of smelt
and truffle, cover the whole with a layer of <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat,
one-half inch thick.</p>

<p>Now fill the mould in the following <span class="nw">way:—</span>On the layer of
forcemeat covering the fillets at the bottom of the mould set
as many slices of truffle as will cover it; spread another layer
of forcemeat on the truffle, and over that lay, alternately, a
sufficient quantity of fillets of smelt and anchovy. Follow with
a fresh layer of forcemeat, slices of truffle, &amp;c., until the mould
is full, and finish with a layer of forcemeat.</p>

<p>Poach the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> (covered) in a moderate oven, and allow
fifty minutes for one prepared in a quart-mould. It is very
easy, however, to tell when the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> is done, by simply
thrusting a small knife into it; if the blade of the knife withdraws
quite clean, the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> is cooked.</p>

<p>As soon as it is ready, turn the mould upside-down on a
dish, and raise it a little in order to allow the liquid, which
always accumulates in more or less large quantities, to drain
away. Soak up this liquid; gently draw off the mould; take
off the paper, and remove the froth which may have formed on
the fillets by means of a wet brush.</p>

<p>Lay a fine, grooved mushroom on the top of the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>;
surround it with <i>mousseline</i> sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.92">92</a>), finished with
crayfish butter, and send a sauceboat of the same <i>mousseline</i>
sauce to the table with the dish.</p>

<p>N.B.—This <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> may also be prepared with fillets of sole,
of salmon, or of trout, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1008—Haddock"><a id="rcp.1008"
 >1008—HADDOCK</a></h3>

<p>Sometimes the fish is grilled, but, after having boned it and
removed its fins and the greater part of its belly, it is more
often cooked in water or milk, either of which moistening is
usually short.</p>

<p>It is plunged in slightly salted boiling water, and then it
is moved to the side of the fire to poach, with lid on. Allow
about fifteen minutes for a fish weighing one and one-half lbs.</p>

<p>Dish it with a few tablespoonfuls of its cooking-liquor, and,
subject to the consumer’s taste, serve some fresh or melted
butter separately.</p>

<p>Season them; sprinkle them with melted butter, and grill
them gently, taking care to baste them by means of a brush
with melted butter while they are cooking.</p>

<p>Set them on a round, hot dish, and sprinkle them with
half-melted butter à la Maître-d’Hôtel, after having drawn their
halves together, that they may seem natural and untouched.</p>

<p>Or surround them with grooved slices of lemon, and send

 >1024—MORUE AND SALTED COD (Morue et Cabillaud Salé)</a></h3>

<p>Salted cod bought in England has generally been fished
somewhere along the English coast, and is, as a rule, of
recent salting. It has not the peculiar flavour of the Icelandic
<i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>, or that of the Newfoundland specimens, and it does not
lend itself to such a large variety of preparations as these two.</p>

<p>At the end of each of the following recipes, I indicate the
kind of cod to which the procedure may be applied.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_morue">Morue</a></i>, especially the Newfoundland kind, should be set
to soak at least twelve hours before being used, and the water
during that time should be frequently changed.</p>

<p>When about to cook it, suppress its fins, and cut it up in
a way befitting the selected mode of preparation.</p>

<p>Allow four oz. gross of the fish for each person.</p>

 >1024a—SALTED COD AND MORUE <span class="nw">A L’ANGLAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Put the fish into cold water; set to boil, and as soon as this
point is reached, leave the fish to poach on the side of the fire
for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Drain, skin, dish on a napkin, and serve, separately, a
timbale of parsnips and an egg-sauce à l’Écossaise.</p>

<p>Both kinds of cod may be used for this dish.</p>

 >1025—MORUE <span class="nw">A LA BÉNÉDICTINE</span><!-- TN: original reads "BÉNEDICTINE" --></a></h3>

<p>Poach one and one-half lbs. of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> as above; drain it
and cut into small pieces, cleared of all skin and bone. Pound
it quickly while it is still hot, and add to it half its weight of
potatoes cooked as for a purée, drained, and dried in the oven
for a few minutes. When the whole has been reduced to a
fine paste, add one-sixth pint of oil, and one-quarter pint
of boiled milk. The oil and the milk should be added
little by little, and the paste should be more mellow than stiff.</p>

<p>Cut the <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> into squares or rectangles; roll these into
<i><a href="#g_paupiette">paupiettes</a></i> or scrolls, and bind these with a piece of string.
Poach them in the usual way; drain them; scrape their skins,
and dish them. Sprinkle with <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> parsley; add lemon
juice, and cover with brown or lightly-browned butter. Either
kind of cod may be used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1027—Brandade de Morue" id="g_brandade"><a id="rcp.1027"
 >1027—BRANDADE DE MORUE</a></h3>

<p>Cut one lb. of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> into pieces, and poach these for eight
minutes. The eight minutes should be counted from the time
the water begins to boil.</p>

<p>Drain on a sieve, and clear the pieces of all skin and bones.
Heat in a sautépan one-sixth pint of oil until the latter
smokes; throw the cleaned pieces of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> into the oil; add a
piece of crushed garlic the size of a haricot-bean, and stir over
a brisk fire with a wooden spoon until the <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> is reduced to
shreds.</p>

<p>Then take the saucepan off the fire, and, without ceasing to
stir the paste, add thereto, little by little, as for a mayonnaise,
about one-half pint of oil. When the paste begins to stiffen
through the addition of the oil, now and again add a tablespoonful
of milk. For the amount of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> used, one-quarter
pint of boiling milk should thus be added by degrees.</p>

<p>When the Brandade is finished, it should have the consistence
of an ordinary potato purée. When about to serve, taste
the preparation, and rectify its seasoning.</p>

<p>Dish the Brandade in a hot timbale, building it up in the
shape of a pyramid, and set thereon a crown of bread-crumb
triangles fried in butter just before dishing up.</p>

<p>N.B.—The triangles of fried bread may, with advantage, be
replaced by lozenges made from puff-paste, which are baked
without colouration. For the Brandade use only well-soaked
Icelandic or Newfoundland <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1028—Brandade de Morue à la Crème"><a id="rcp.1028"
 >1028—BRANDADE DE MORUE <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span></a></h3>

<p>Follow the directions given above, but instead of oil and

<p>Finely mince an onion, and cook it gently in butter until
it is of a nice golden colour. Spread it on the bottom of a
little oval earthenware dish, and set three tomatoes prepared
à la Provençale (No. <a href="#rcp.2268">2268</a>) upon it.</p>

<p>Poach one lb.<!-- TN: period invisible --> of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>; drain it as soon as ready, and flake
it while clearing it of all skin and bones. Lay this flaked
<i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> on the slices of tomato; cover it with three mild capsicums,
split and broiled; sprinkle the whole with a few drops
of lemon juice and one oz. of lightly-browned butter, and put
the dish in the oven for a few minutes. Serve very hot.</p>

<p>Icelandic or Newfoundland <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> may be used.</p>

<p>Poach one lb. of salted cod or <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>, and flake it while
clearing it of all skin and bones. Mix this flaked fish with
two-thirds pint of Indienne sauce, and dish it in a hot timbale.</p>

<p>Serve some rice à l’Indienne separately.</p>

<p>Both kinds of fish are suited to this dish.</p>

<p>Poach one lb. of <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>, and flake it as explained above.
Finely mince a medium-sized onion, and toss it in butter. Also
toss three medium-sized potatoes cut into roundels. Heat one oz. of butter and two tablespoonfuls of oil in a frying-pan; put
therein the flaked <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> and the potatoes, and toss the whole
over a brisk fire for a few minutes.</p>

<p>When about to dish up, add a few drops of vinegar.</p>

<p>Dish in a hot timbale, and sprinkle the <i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i> with a
pinch of chopped parsley. Use either the Icelandic or the
Newfoundland fish for this preparation.</p>

<p>Finely pound one-quarter lb. of freshly poached and flaked
<i><a href="#g_morue">morue</a></i>, and add thereto, little by little, two tablespoonfuls of
hot and very thick Béchamel sauce. When the paste is very
smooth, season it; put into a saucepan, heat it, and add the
yolks of three eggs, and four whites beaten to a stiff froth.</p>

<p>Put the whole into a buttered soufflé-saucepan, and cook
after the manner of an ordinary <a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a>. Take either Icelandic

 >1034—CHAR (Ombre-Chevalier)</a></h3>

<p>The char is a fish of the salmon family, which is
culinarily treated in exactly the same way as the trout. When
it is large, the recipes given for salmon trout may be adapted
to it, but it is mostly used small—that is to say, from five
inches to ten inches long. The fishing of char is restricted
chiefly to lake countries, such as Scotland and Switzerland, and
it is only in season during two months of the year. Moreover,
as this fish loses much of its quality in transit, its scarcity
on the market will be easily understood. The lake of Zug, in
Switzerland, supplies the most famous specimens, which are
called Rothel by the people of the locality. The delicacy of
the fish is remarkable, and in this it may vie even with the
best river trout.</p>

<p>The char of the Scotch lakes may be treated after the same
recipes as the Swiss specimens, but they are more often used
in the preparation of potted char, the recipe for which is as
<span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1035—Potted Char"><a id="rcp.1035"
 >1035—POTTED CHAR</a></h3>

<p>Cook the chars in a fine <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">mirepoix</a></i> with white wine, exactly
after the manner of trout. When the fish are cooked, leave
them to cool completely in their cooking-liquor. Drain them;
skin them; separate their fillets, and thoroughly bone them.
Set the fillets in a special earthenware pot; entirely cover them
with clarified butter, and put them in a moderate oven for one
quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Leave them to cool until the next day, and add sufficient
clarified butter to cover them with a layer one-third inch thick.</p>

<p>If Potted Char be left in the cool, it will keep for some
considerable time.</p>


<h3 title="Red Mullets (Rougets)">RED MULLETS (ROUGETS)</h3>

<p>Red mullet, especially the Mediterranean rock kind, is one
of the greatest fish delicacies known; and the surname “Sea
Woodcock,” which gourmets sometimes give it, is quite justified,
not only by its quality, but by the fact that, except for its
gills, it is generally left whole, and not even emptied.</p>

<p>It is best grilled.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1035a—Grilled Red Mullet"><a id="rcp.1035a"
 >1035a—GRILLED RED MULLET</a></h3>

<p>Carefully wipe the mullet; <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> it on either side to a depth
in proportion to the thickness of its flesh and at closer intervals
the thicker the latter is, in order to facilitate the cooking; season
it with salt and pepper; sprinkle it with a little oil and a few
drops of lemon juice; spread a few slices of lemon and a few
<a id="png.366" href="#png.366"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>348<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>parsley stalks upon and beneath it; and let it <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for an
hour or two, turning it over frequently the while.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes before serving, set the red mullet on a
double fish grill, and cook it over a rather fierce fire,
sprinkling it often the while with its <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>. Dish and serve
it as soon as it is ready, and serve a little half-melted maître-d’hôtel
butter separately.</p>

aromatics. Twenty minutes before serving, add two oz. of
roughly-chopped raw pork fat and a little parsley to the
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>; wrap the red mullets in strong, oiled paper, together
with its <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>, grill it gently, and serve it as it stands.</p>

<i>souffléd</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1036—Whitebait"><a id="rcp.1036"
 >1036—WHITEBAIT</a></h3>

<p>Thames whitebait, which has many points in common with
the “Nonat” of the Mediterranean, is one of the riddles of
ichthyology; for, while it is generally admitted that it is the
fry of one of the many species of fish, its real parentage is
quite unknown.</p>

<p>At dinners in London it usually stands as a second fish-course,
and, fried after the customary manner, it constitutes a
dish the delicacy of which is incomparable. Whitebait, like
the nonat, are extremely fragile, and ought to be cooked as
soon as they are caught. They are always served fried, and
the frying-medium used in their preparation should be fresh,
abundant, and just smoking when the fish are plunged into it.
Previous to this operation, however, the whitebait ought to
be thoroughly dredged with flour and placed in a special sieve
<a id="png.367" href="#png.367"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>349<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or frying basket, either of which should be well shaken, in
order to rid the fish of any superfluous flour.</p>

<p>They are then plunged into the smoking frying-medium,
in small quantities at a time, and one minute’s stay therein
suffices to render them sufficiently crisp.</p>

<p>Draining is the next operation, effected upon a spread piece
of linen, that the fish may be easily seasoned with table-salt
and cayenne, mixed. This done, the whitebait are dished upon
a napkin and sent to the table with very green, fried parsley.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1037—Matelote au Vin Rouge"><a id="rcp.1037"
 >1037—MATELOTE AU VIN ROUGE</a></h3>

<p>The fish used for the Matelote are eel, carp, tench, bream,
perch, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It may be prepared from one or many kinds of fish.</p>

<p>Put the fish, cut into sections, into a sautépan. For two lbs.
of it, add one minced onion, one faggot, two cloves of garlic,
one pint of red wine, a pinch of salt, and another of pepper or
four peppercorns.</p>

<p>Set to boil; add three tablespoonfuls of heated and burnt
brandy; cover the sautépan, and complete the cooking of the
fish.</p>

<p>This done, transfer the pieces to another saucepan; strain
the cooking-liquor, reduce it by a third, and thicken it with
<i><a href="#g_manied">manied</a></i> butter (consisting of one and one-half oz. of butter and
one tablespoonful of flour), cut into small pieces.</p>

<p>When the leason has been properly effected, pour the
resulting sauce over the pieces of fish; heat, and dish in a
timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1038—Matelote au Vin Blanc"><a id="rcp.1038"
 >1038—MATELOTE AU VIN BLANC</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the fish as above, but use white wine instead of
red<!-- TN: original reads "red wine instead of
white" -->, and burn the brandy as before. When the pieces of fish
are cooked, transfer them to another saucepan with small
onions, previously cooked in butter, and small, cooked mushrooms.
Strain the cooking-liquor, reduce it to a little less than
half, thicken it with fish velouté, and finish with one oz. of
butter.</p>

<p>Pour this sauce over the fish and the garnish; dish the whole
in a timbale or a deep dish, and surround with crayfish, cooked
in <i>court-bouillon</i>, and little crusts in the shape of hearts, fried
in butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1039—Bouillabaisse à la Marseillaise"><a id="png.368" href="#png.368"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.1039"
 >1039—BOUILLABAISSE <span class="nw">A LA MARSEILLAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>The fish for Bouillabaisse are rascasse, chapon, dory,
whiting, fiélas<!-- TN original reads "fielas" -->, boudreuil, spiny lobster, red mullet, gurnet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cut the larger fish into slices; leave the smaller ones whole,
and with the exception of the whiting and the red mullet, which
cook more speedily than the others, put them all into a saucepan.</p>

<p>For two lbs. of fish, add one small onion, the chopped white
of one leek, one small, peeled, pressed and chopped tomato,
two crushed cloves of garlic, a large pinch of <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> parsley,
a pinch of powdered saffron, a bit of bay, a little savory and
fennel, and two tablespoonfuls of oil.</p>

<p>Moisten the fish with just enough cold water to cover it,
and season with one-third oz. of salt and a pinch of pepper
per quart of water.</p>

<p>Set to boil, and cook over a brisk fire. At the end of eight
minutes add the pieces of whiting and red mullet, and leave to
cook for a further seven minutes.</p>

<p>Pour the liquor of the bouillabaisse over some slices of
household bread lying on the bottom of a deep dish; set the
fish on another dish with the sections of spiny lobster all round,
and serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1040—Quenelles de Brochet à la Lyonnaise"><a id="rcp.1040"
 >1040—QUENELLES DE BROCHET <span class="nw">A LA LYONNAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Pound separately one lb. of the meat of pike, cleared of
all skin and bones, and one lb. of the fat of kidney of beef,
very dry, cleaned, and cut into small pieces. If desired, half
of the weight of the fat of kidney of beef may be replaced by
one-half lb. of beef marrow.</p>

<p>Put the pounded meat of the pike and the kidney fat on
separate plates. Now pound one lb. of frangipan<!-- TN: original reads "frangipane" --> Panada
(No. <a href="#rcp.192">192</a>) and add thereto, little by little, the white of four
little eggs. Put the pike meat and the fat back into the mortar,
and finely pound the whole until a fine, smooth paste is
obtained. Rub the latter through a sieve; put the resulting
purée into a basin, and work it well with a wooden spoon in
order to smooth it.</p>

<p>With this forcemeat mould some quenelles with a spoon,
and poach them in salted water.</p>

<p>If these quenelles are to be served with an ordinary fish
sauce, put them into it as soon as they are poached and drained,
and simmer them in it for ten minutes that they may swell.</p>

<p>If the sauce intended for them is to be thickened with egg-yolks,
and buttered at the last moment, put them into a saucepan
<a id="png.369" href="#png.369"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>351<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with a few tablespoonfuls of <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, and simmer them as
directed in the case of an ordinary fish sauce, taking care to
keep the saucepan well covered that the concentrated steam
may assist the swelling of the quenelles. In this case they are
added to the sauce at the last moment.</p>

<p>N.B.—Slices of truffle may always be added to the sauce.
The quenelles are dished either in a silver timbale, in a shallow
timbale-crust, or in a fine vol-au-vent crust, in accordance with
the arrangement of the menu.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1041—Fish Cakes"><a id="rcp.1041"
 >1041—FISH CAKES</a></h3>

<p>Fish cakes or balls, which are greatly appreciated in both
England and America, are made from any boiled fish. Salted
cod, however, is best suited to their preparation, and is therefore
used much more often than other kinds of fish.</p>

<p>Flake one lb. of cooked cod, and clear it of all skin and
bones; pound it with one-half lb. of freshly-cooked, floury
potatoes, two tablespoonfuls of reduced Béchamel sauce, and
two whole eggs. Season with salt and pepper. When the
paste has been well beaten and is smooth, take it out of the
mortar and divide it into portions weighing about two oz. Roll
these portions into balls upon a flour-dusted mixing-board,
flatten them out to the shape of thick quoits, and treat them
<a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>.</p>

<p>Fry them at the last moment in very hot fat, and dish them
on a napkin with fried parsley all round.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1042—Waterzoi"><a id="rcp.1042"
 >1042—WATERZOI</a></h3>

<p>In order to prepare Waterzoi, it is best, when possible, to
have live fish at one’s disposal, not only because these are
better able to resist the cooking process, but also owing to the
fact that they are richer in gelatine in the live state.</p>

<p>The fish more generally used are the eel, the perch, the
tench, the carp, the pike, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After having scaled and emptied them, trim them and cut
off their heads and tails. Cut the fish into sections; moisten
these with just enough cold water to cover them; add a piece
of butter, sufficient parsley roots or stalks to produce a decided
taste, a few peppercorns, and some salt.</p>

<p>Set to cook on a brisk fire, and take care that the cooking-liquor
be reduced and sufficiently thickened when the fish are
cooked.</p>

<p>Serve in a timbale or on a dish, and send some slices of
bread and butter to the table at the same time.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XV<br
 ><small>RELEVÉS AND ENTRÉES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">The</span> difference between Relevés and Entrées needs only to
be examined very superficially in order for it to be seen how
entirely the classification hangs on the question of bulk.
Indeed, with very few exceptions, the same alimentary products—butcher’s
meat, fish, poultry, and game—may be used
with perfect propriety in the preparation of either Relevés or
Entrées. And if the mode of preparation and the nature of
the garnishing ingredients are sometimes dissimilar, it is owing
to that difference in bulk referred to above, on account of which
the Relevés, being more voluminous, are usually braised,
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i>, poached, or roasted; while the Entrées, consisting of
smaller pieces, are chiefly <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, poached, or grilled.</p>

<p>In the menus of old-fashioned dinners à la Française, the
line of demarcation between Relevés and Entrées was far more
clearly defined, the latter being generally twice, if not thrice,
as numerous as the former. The first service of a dinner for
twenty people, for instance, comprised eight or twelve Entrées
and four soups, all of which were set on the dining-table before
the admission of the diners. As soon as the soups were served,
the Relevés, to the number of four, two of which consisted of
fish, took the place of the soups on the table; they <i>relieved</i>
the soups; hence their name, which now, of course, is quite
meaningless.</p>

<p>The Russian method of serving greatly simplified the practice
just described. Nowadays a dinner rarely consists of more
than two soups, two Relevés (one of which is fish), and two
or three Entrées for the first service. Very often the fish
Relevé, instead of being a large piece of fish, only consists
of fillets of sole, of chicken-turbots, &amp;c., or timbales, which are
real entrées; while the Relevés (consisting of large pieces of
butcher’s meat or game), instead of being served as common
sense would dictate, <i>i.e.</i>, after the fish Relevé, when the diner’s
appetite is still keen, are placed, according to English custom,
after the Entrées.</p>

 ></span></span></a>Thus, as the two above examples show, the parts played
by the Relevés and Entrées respectively are very far from
being clearly defined; and I therefore resolved to treat of them
both in the same chapter, and to append a few grills (usually
accompanied by various sauces and garnishes), which are really
only luncheon-roasts. The indications given concerning the
class to which the recipes belong will suffice to avoid confusion.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1043—Fillet of Beef (Relevé)"><a id="rcp.1043"
 >1043—FILLET OF BEEF (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>Fillet of beef for a Relevé may consist either of the whole
piece, trimmed, studded, or larded, or a more or less large
piece cut from the whole, and treated after one of the methods
suited to the whole fillet. The fillet may be braised, <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i>,
or roasted; but the last two modes of preparation suit it best,
as it is generally preferred underdone and somewhat red
towards the centre.</p>

<p>The garnishes for a Relevé of fillet of beef are as numerous
as they are varied; and, as they are applicable not only to
fillet of beef but to all Relevés of butcher’s meat, I give them
here in preference, since fillet of beef may be considered the
choicest of Relevés.</p>

<p>Having removed all the connective tissue from the fillet, lard
it with thin strips of bacon, and <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poële</a></i> or roast it. Glaze it at
the last moment; set it on a long dish, and surround it <span class="nw">with:—</span>(1) Some grilled half-capsicums, filled with rice à la grecque
(No. <a href="#rcp.2253">2253</a>); (2) roundels of egg-plant, two inches in diameter
and one inch thick, hollowed out to form cases, fried in oil,
and garnished with <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> tomatoes tossed in oil. Arrange
the half-capsicums and the egg-plant alternately round the
fillet, and place a grilled <i><a href="#g_chipolata">chipolata</a></i> sausage between each.</p>

<p>Having larded the fillet and <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i> or roasted it, set it on
a long dish and surround it <span class="nw">with:—</span>(1) Small heaps of carrots
and turnips, turned by means of a small grooved spoon, and
cooked in consommé; (2) small heaps of little potatoes turned
to the shape of olives and cooked in butter; (3) small heaps of

butter; (4) five bunches of cauliflower.</p>

<p>Arrange these different products in such wise as to vary
their colours and throw them into relief.</p>

<p>Serve the gravy of the fillet separately, after having cleared
it of all grease and strained it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1046—Filet de Bœuf Camargo"><a id="rcp.1046"
 >1046—FILET DE BŒUF CAMARGO</a></h3>

<p>Trim the fillet; suppress the long muscle lying on its thicker
side (Fr. chaîne), and open the meat lengthwise from the same
side. Withdraw the meat from the inside of the fillet so as to
leave a wall of meat only one-half inch thick all round. Finely
chop the withdrawn meat and combine with it, per lb., little
by little, from four to five tablespoonfuls of cream and four oz.
of fresh foie gras. Season with salt and pepper, rectify the
consistence of the paste, and add thereto, per lb., two oz. of
chopped truffles.</p>

<p>Fill the hollow fillet with this forcemeat, thereby returning
it to its original shape, and stud its top surface with pointed
pieces of truffle one inch long by one-quarter inch wide, stuck
into the meat aslant. In order to facilitate this operation, bore
the meat, before the insertion of the pieces of truffles, by means
of a small knife.</p>

<p>Now cover the fillet with slices of bacon and string it
laterally, leaving a space of one inch between each strand.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poële</a></i> the meat carefully, and take care that the forcemeat
inside be well, but not over-done. This may be ascertained by
thrusting a braiding needle into the thickest part of the fillet,
as soon as the meat seems resisting and elastic to the touch.
If the needle withdraws clean, the fillet is ready.</p>

<p>Now glaze it, after having cut away the string and removed
the slices of bacon; dish it, and surround it with the following
<span class="nw">garnish:—</span>Small tartlet-crusts garnished by means of noodles
with cream; a slice of foie gras stamped out with a round cutter
and tossed in butter, upon the noodles; and a fine slice of truffle
on the foie gras.</p>

 >1075—FILET DE BŒUF FROID (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>Fillet of beef, when properly dished, makes an excellent cold
Relevé.</p>

<p>For this purpose lard it, roast it (keeping it somewhat underdone
towards the centre), and, when it is quite cold, trim, and
coat it with half-melted jelly.</p>

<p>Then set it either directly upon a dish or upon a cushion
of bread or carved rice, which makes the dish more sightly
when the garnish is added.</p>

<p>Before setting the fillet on the dish or on the cushion of rice,
it is well to cut a slice one-fifth inch thick from the whole of its
base; leave this slice under the fillet when dishing; by this
means, when the carving is proceeded with, each slice will be
found to be neatly trimmed.</p>

<p>Cold fillet of beef allows of every possible cold vegetable
garnish.</p>

<p>The vegetables should be cooked with the greatest care and
be left to cool naturally.</p>

<p>When they are quite cold, either cohere them by means of
jelly, or set them round the fillet in neat heaps, taking care to
alternate their shades, and coat them with almost melted aspic.</p>

<p>Finally, between each heap of vegetables lay a little chopped
and very clear aspic, and, round the whole, arrange a border
consisting of bits of aspic (round, oval, square, lozenge-shaped, &amp;c.) very regularly cut.</p>

<p>I see no reason for devoting any further space to this subject.
What has been said should, I think, suffice to show how varied
and numerous are the possible ways of dishing cold fillet of beef,
the minute details of which may, with advantage, be left to the
ingenuity of the operator.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1076—Châteaubriand, Fillet Steak, Tournedos"><a id="rcp.1076"
 >1076—CHÂTEAUBRIAND, FILLET STEAK, TOURNEDOS</a></h3>

<p>By <i>fillet</i> steaks are understood those pieces of meat cut
laterally from the thickest part of the fillet of beef.</p>

<p>They ought to be about one and one-half inches thick, and
weigh from six to seven oz. Tournedos are half-fillets in respect
of their weight, and might well be called the “kernels”
of the fillet of beef. The usual thickness of a tournedos is
about one and one-quarter inches, and they should be cut to a
nice, round shape. With the object of preserving their shape,
they may be tied round with string.</p>

<p>Châteaubriand is also procured from the centre of fillet of
<a id="png.381" href="#png.381"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>363<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beef, and its weight is often twice, thrice, and sometimes more
than thrice as much as that of the ordinary fillet steaks.</p>

<p>As a rule, especially when grilled, it constitutes a special
roast for luncheons; when it is cooked in the saucepan, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, it is more often served as a Relevé.</p>

<p>The same garnishes suit fillet, Châteaubriands, and
tournedos, the only necessary modifications being in respect
of size and arrangement, which should be subject to the size of
the piece of meat.</p>

<p>The garnishes detailed hereafter are for the tournedos, which
supply the greatest number of the dishes prepared from the
three different cuts of fillet. If a fillet steak be prepared after
one of the following recipes, the garnish should be made a little
stronger, and its constituents modified in the dishing, neither
of which changes need in any way alter the formula.</p>

<p>The same holds with regard to a Châteaubriand. Thus, for
example, if it be required to prepare a fillet steak or a Châteaubriand,
after the recipe “Tournedos à l’Algérienne,” the
number of <i>croquettes</i> and tomatoes should be half as much
again, and they should be arranged alternately round the meat,
instead of the latter being placed on the <i>croquettes</i>, as in the
case of the tournedos.</p>

<p>If the fillets are to be treated “à l’Alsacienne,” after the
recipe for tournedos, the sauerkraut should be dished in a timbale
instead of in tartlet-crusts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All that is needed, therefore, is a change in the method of
arrangement, and this can be decided upon at a glance, without
necessarily interfering with the principle of the recipe.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that nearly all the garnishes
given under fillet of beef, served whole, may be applied to
Châteaubriands, fillet steak, and tournedos, provided they
be made in proportion to the size of the different pieces. I
see no need, therefore, to repeat these vegetable recipes in so
far as they relate to the various cuts of fillet of beef.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add that for the fillet of beef, as well
as for tournedos, noisettes, &amp;c., a large number of plain
vegetable garnishes may be used, the details of which I prefer
to omit for fear of unduly lengthening this work.</p>

<p>Whole fillets, fillet steak, and tournedos may thus be served
with garnishes of braised celery, tuberous fennel, cardoons with
gravy, chow-chow and endives, braised lettuce, various purées, &amp;c., and, generally, with all the vegetable preparations given
in <a href="#png.623">Chapter XVII</a>.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Important Remarks relative to the Sauces suited to
Entrées of Butcher’s Meat, Garnished with Vegetables"><a id="png.382" href="#png.382"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>364<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Important Remarks relative to the Sauces suited to
Entrées of Butcher’s Meat, Garnished with Vegetables</h3>

<p>The derivative sauces of the Espagnole are not, as a rule,
suited to entrées garnished with vegetables. Thickened gravy
is better.</p>

<p>The finest adjunct, however, is meat-glaze, which should
receive an addition of four oz. of butter per pint, and should
be slightly acidulated by means of a few drops of lemon juice.
This glaze ought to be so light as not to impaste the vegetables.</p>

<p>Such vegetables as asparagus-heads, peas, French beans,
<i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoines</a></i>, &amp;c., have a disintegrating action upon the sauces,
and this is owing either to their natural moisture or to their
leason. As a result of this action the preparation has an unsightly
appearance when served upon the diner’s plate.</p>

<p>With Châteaubriand sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.71">71</a>) or buttered meat-glaze
this objection does not obtain, seeing that this sauce does not
decompose, but combines admirably with the garnish, and lends
the latter a certain noticeable mellowness.</p>

<p>I therefore emphasise this point, viz., that the derivative
sauces of the Espagnole and tomato sauces should be exclusively
used with such preparations garnished with truffles, cock’s
combs and kidneys, quenelles and mushrooms, as “la
Financière,” “la Godard,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sirloin of beef is that part of the bullock’s back reaching
from the haunch to the floating ribs, which is equivalent to the
saddle in veal and mutton. This piece, however, cannot properly
be called “sirloin,” except when it comprises the fillet
or undercut, and the upper fillet (Fr.: contrefilet), so-called to
distinguish it from the undercut. If this joint be treated
whole, it need only be shortened by suppressing the flank, and
by sectioning the ligament lying alongside of the chine on the
upper fillet, in different places.</p>

<p>A little fat is left on the undercut, but none whatever must
be removed from the upper fillet. As a rule, when sirloin of
beef is braised, it is cut laterally into pieces weighing from
<a id="png.396" href="#png.396"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>378<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>six to seven lbs. If it is to be roasted, it is best to keep it
whole.</p>

<p>When served as a relevé, it is braised or roasted, and is
kept underdone if so desired. Unless it be of excellent quality,
however, braised sirloin generally turns out to be dry.</p>

<p>All garnishes given for “Filet de Bœuf” may be served
with sirloin; but, as a rule, the bulkiest, such as the “Richelieu,”
the “Provençale,” the “Godard,” &amp;c., are selected.</p>

<p>The accompanying sauce is that indicated for the above
garnishes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1142—Porterhouse-steak (Grill)"><a id="rcp.1142"
 >1142—PORTERHOUSE-STEAK (Grill)</a></h3>

<p>Porterhouse-steak is a slice from the sirloin of beef, which
may be more or less thick. It is cleared of the flank and of
the bones of the chine, and it is always grilled.</p>

<p>It may be served with any of the various garnishes and
sauces suited to grills; but it is more often served plain.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1143—Upper Fillet and Ribs of Beef (Relevé)"><a id="rcp.1143"
 >1143—UPPER FILLET AND RIBS OF BEEF (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>The upper fillet is that part of beef which lies between the
top of the haunch and the floating ribs, alongside of the chine.
It may be treated like the fillet, and all the garnishes suited
to the latter may also be applied here.</p>

<p>If the piece is to be braised, it should be completely boned;
if intended for roasting, it is best to retain the bones. In the
latter case, the large ligament should be cut at various points
with the view of preventing distortion, while the bones constituting
the spinous process should be broken close to the point
where they join the body of the vertebræ, that they may be
easily removed when the meat is being carved.</p>

<p>The upper fillet, especially when it is of good quality, is
best roasted.</p>

<p>Ribs of beef may likewise be braised or roasted.</p>

<p>In either case, the meat should be properly trimmed and
cleared of all the bones of the spinous process.</p>

<p>This piece should only be used after having been well hung,
in order that it may be as tender as possible.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1144—Grilled Sirloin Steaks and Ribs of Beef"><a id="rcp.1144"
 >1144—GRILLED SIRLOIN STEAKS AND RIBS OF BEEF</a></h3>

<p>The sirloin steak may be cut either from the upper fillet or
the ribs of beef, <i>i.e.</i>, between two rib-bones. In order that its
cooking may be regular, it should not weigh more than from
two to three lbs.</p>

<p>Ribs of beef may also be grilled, provided they be sufficiently
tender.</p>

<p><a id="png.397" href="#png.397"><span class="pagenum"><span

with any of the various garnishes given under Fillet of Beef.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1145—Pièce de Bœuf Braisée (Relevé)"><a id="rcp.1145"
 >1145—PIÈCE DE BŒUF BRAISÉE (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>The piece of beef called rump is the one preferred for boiling
and braising. Whatever be the use for which the meat is intended,
the weight of the pieces should not be more than six
or eight lbs. at the most, and they should be cut in the length
rather than in the thickness, that the cooking process may be
facilitated.</p>

<p>All the garnishes of braised sirloin of beef are suited to
braised pieces of beef.</p>

<p>Boiled beef is generally accompanied by the vegetables used
in its cooking-process, by purées, green or dry vegetables,
pastes, macaroni, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lard the piece of beef, and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> it for three hours in
brandy and red wine. Braise it after the manner described
under No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>; moisten first with the wine of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>,
and, when the latter is reduced, with some veal gravy and one-half
pint of Espagnole sauce per quart of liquid, taking care
that the whole moistening reaches the top of the piece of meat.
Add a faggot and some mushroom parings; set to boil, and
cook gently in the oven.</p>

<p>When the meat is two-thirds cooked, transfer it to another
saucepan, and surround it with mushrooms cut into two or four,
according to their size, and tossed in butter; breast of bacon,
cut<!-- TN: original reads "out" --> into dice, <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> and tossed in butter, and some small
onions half-glazed with butter.</p>

<p>Strain the sauce through a sieve over the piece of beef and
its garnish, and complete the cooking gently.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, put the meat on a dish and
glaze it in the oven. Transfer the meat to the dish intended
for the table; quickly reduce the sauce if necessary, and pour
it over the piece of beef and the garnish.</p>

 >1147—PIÈCE DE BŒUF <span class="nw">A LA CUILLER</span></a></h3>

<p>Select a very square or oval piece of beef, and bear in mind,
in selecting it, that it will have to be fashioned to the shape of
a case when it has been cooked.</p>

<p>String it, and braise it after the manner described under
No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>, almost entirely covering it with moistening liquor.</p>

<p>Set it to cook gently; withdraw the piece when the meat is
still somewhat firm, and let it cool under slight pressure.</p>

<p><a id="png.398" href="#png.398"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>380<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This done, cut out the meat from the inside; leave a thickness
of about half-inch round the sides and on the bottom, and
the piece thus emptied should constitute a square or oval case,
in accordance with the shape originally adopted.</p>

<p>Coat the outside of the whole piece with a mixture of beaten
eggs and fine bread-crumbs, combined with Parmesan; sprinkle
melted butter over it with a brush, and put the case into a
sufficiently hot oven to allow of a crust forming round it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile chop up the meat extracted from the inside of
the piece; add thereto a little salted tongue, some braised slices
of sweet-bread, and mushrooms; put the whole into a sautépan
with an Italian or a half-glaze sauce, according to the requirements,
and heat this garnish.</p>

<p>N.B.—This preparation was quite common in old-fashioned
cookery, but though it is still served occasionally, it is now
looked upon more as a curiosity than anything else. As a
curiosity, therefore, I chose to include it among these recipes;
but it does not follow from this that I in any way recommend it.</p>

 >1148—PIÈCE DE BŒUF <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Lard the piece of beef, and braise it as explained under
No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile prepare the following <span class="nw">garnish:—</span>(1) Cut a nice
firm cabbage into four, remove the heart, and parboil it for
seven or eight minutes. Drain it; cool it; divide up the
quarters, leaf by leaf, so as to remove the hard ribs, and season
with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Mould them to the shape of balls by pressing them in the
corner of a towel into balls weighing about three oz. each, or
simply put them into a saucepan with a quartered carrot, an
onion stuck with a clove, a faggot, six oz. of <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> breast
of pork, and a little raw sausage with garlic, which latter must
be withdrawn after cooking has gone on for one and one-half
hours.</p>

<p>Moisten the cabbage with just sufficient consommé to cover
it; add a few tablespoonfuls of good stock-fat; set to boil, and
cook gently in the oven for one and one-half hours.</p>

<p>(2) Cut the required quantity of carrots and turnips to the
shape of olives; cook them in consommé, and reduce the latter
for the purpose of glazing.</p>

<p>(3) Prepare some potatoes <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>.</p>

<p>Set the piece of beef on a dish large enough to allow of the
former being surrounded with the moulded or plainly-heaped
cabbages, the glazed carrots and turnips, and the potatoes <i>à</i>

heaps with the cabbages and the bacon (cut into small rectangles)
and the sausage (cut into roundels) should be distributed all
round.</p>

<p>Serve separately the gravy of the piece of beef, cleared of all
grease, reduced to a half-glaze and strained.</p>

 >1149—PIÈCE DE BŒUF <span class="nw">A LA MODE CHAUDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Lard the piece of beef, which should not, if possible, weigh
more than from four to five lbs. The strips of bacon used for
larding ought to have been prepared fifteen or twenty minutes
in advance, <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> in a few tablespoonfuls of brandy, and
sprinkled with parsley just before being used.</p>

<p>Rub the piece with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and put it into
a basin with one bottle of red wine and one-fifth pint of brandy,
and set it to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for four or five hours, taking care to
turn it over from time to time.</p>

<p>Then set it to braise after the manner described under No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>; add its <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> to the moistening, and surround it with
three small, boned, <a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a>, and strung calf’s feet.</p>

<p>When the cooking is three-quarters done, transfer the piece
of beef to another saucepan, and surround it with the following
<span class="nw">garnish:—</span></p>

<p>1. About one-quarter lb. of carrots turned to the shape of
elongated olives, and already two-thirds cooked.</p>

<p>2. Small onions coloured in two-thirds lb. of butter.</p>

<p>3. The calf’s feet cut into small, square, or rectangular
pieces.</p>

<p>Strain the braising-liquor over the whole, and complete the
cooking gently. When about to serve, either glaze the piece
of beef, or dish it plain; coat it lightly with sauce, and send
what remains of the latter, with the garnish, in a timbale.</p>

<p>Bœuf à la mode is very rarely prepared specially for cold
dishing, the remains of a fine piece being generally used for
that purpose. The piece of meat must first be well trimmed.
If the quantity of sauce do not seem enough, or if the sauce
itself seem too stiff, add a third of its volume of aspic jelly
to it.</p>

<p>For moulding, take a <i><a href="#g_terrine_2">terrine à pâté</a></i>, a mould, or other utensil
capable of holding the piece of meat, its garnish, and its sauce.
Deck the bottom of the utensil in any suitable way with the
carrots and the onions, and surround the piece with what
remains of the latter and the dice of calf’s foot.</p>

<p><a id="png.400" href="#png.400"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Lard the piece of beef, and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> it in brandy and red
wine.</p>

<p>This done, dry it thoroughly, and brown it evenly in butter
all over; moisten it with its <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> and an equal quantity of
veal gravy, and set to cook gently.</p>

<p>When the meat is half-cooked, surround it with two lbs. of
minced onions, tossed in butter, and three oz. of rice. Complete
the cooking of the piece with onions and rice.</p>

<p>Now withdraw the piece of beef, and quickly rub the onions
and the rice through tammy. Reduce this Soubise with rice for
a few moments.</p>

<p>Neatly trim the piece of beef; cut it into even slices; reconstruct
it on a dish, and between each slice pour a tablespoonful
of Soubise purée.</p>

<p>Cover the reconstructed piece of beef with the remainder of
the Soubise; sprinkle the surface with two tablespoonfuls of
bread-crumbs fried in butter, and some melted butter, and put
the whole in the oven, that the <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> may form speedily.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1152—The Rump"><a id="rcp.1152"
 >1152—THE RUMP</a></h3>


<h4 class="subhead" title="">Rumpsteak and Beefsteak.</h4>

<p>The rump is that portion of the sirloin of beef which touches
the top of the haunch.</p>

<p>It may be braised, but it is more often grilled in slices from
one inch to one and one-half inches thick, which are called
“rumpsteaks.”</p>

<p>With reference to this subject, it is as well to point out that
the term “Beefsteak,” so hackneyed in France, is scarcely used
in England, owing to its want of precision.</p>

<p>In France, beefsteak is either a cut from the fillet, the upper-fillet,
or the rump, according to the standing of the catering-house
which supplies it. But the nature of the piece cannot
very well be mistaken, inasmuch as the term beefsteak, which
designates it, is generally followed by other French words which
reveal its origin, whereas in England the term “Beefsteak”
does not convey any particular meaning.</p>

<p>Rumpsteak is either grilled or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, but whatever be the
method of cooking it, it is generally served plain.</p>

<p><a id="png.401" href="#png.401"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Ox tongue is served fresh or salted, but, even when it is to
be served fresh, it is all the better for having been put in salt
a few days previously. In order to salt it, put it into a special
brine, as explained under No. <a href="#rcp.172">172</a>. When salted, it is cooked
in boiling water; when fresh, it is braised exactly after the
manner of any other piece of meat.</p>

<p>Ox tongue may be served with almost all the garnishes suited
to relevés of fillet of beef, but more particularly with the <span class="nw">following:—</span>Bourgeoise;
Flamande; Milanaise; Noodles or
Macaroni with cream, cheese or tomatoes; and all vegetable

 >1158—LANGUES DE BŒUF FROIDES</a></h3>

<p>Ox tongues intended for cold dishing should be kept in
brine (No. <a href="#rcp.172">172</a>) for eight or ten days. When about to use them,
put them to soak in cold water for a few hours, and then cook
them plainly in water for three hours.</p>

<p>This done, withdraw them from their cooking-liquor; skin
them; cover them with buttered paper, and let them cool. The
object of the paper is to keep off the air, the tendency of which
is to blacken the surface of the meat.</p>

<p>When quite cool, coat the tongues with a glaze composed of
one-half lb. of gelatine dissolved in one pint of water; the latter
is given a scarlet tint by means of carmine and caramel.</p>

<p>Cold ox tongues are dished amidst aspic jelly dice and curled-leaf
parsley.</p>

<p>N.B.—The gelatine glaze described above will be found a
great improvement upon the coating of reddened gold-beaters’
skin.</p>


<h3 title="Ox Tails">OX TAILS.</h3>

<p>Ox tails, sectioned or unsectioned, are usually braised, and
only the thicker half of the caudal appendage is ever used.</p>

<p>Section the tail, and braise it in white wine, after recipe
No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>.</p>

<p>Prepare a garnish of rectangles of lean bacon, large chestnuts
cooked in consommé and glazed, and small onions cooked in

<h3 class="recipe" title="1160—Queue de Bœuf à la Cavour"><a id="rcp.1160"
 >1160—QUEUE DE BŒUF <span class="nw">A LA CAVOUR</span></a></h3>

<p>Section the tail, and braise it in a moistening two-thirds of
which is brown stock and one-third white wine. It is well for
the moistening to be somewhat abundant. Set to cook very
gently, until the meat falls from the bones, <i>i.e.</i>, for a matter of
about four and one-half or five hours.</p>

<p>This done, dish the sections of the tail in a <i>cocotte</i>; add
some small, cooked mushrooms; clear the cooking-liquor of

<h3 class="recipe" title="1161—Queue de Bœuf Farcie"><a id="rcp.1161"
 >1161—QUEUE DE BŒUF FARCIE</a></h3>

<p>Choose a large ox tail, and bone it carefully without bursting
it.</p>

<p>Lay it on a napkin, and stuff it with a forcemeat consisting
of the following <span class="nw">ingredients:—</span>Three-quarters lb. of very lean
beef and one-half lb. of chopped fat bacon, the two mixed with
four oz. of bread-crumbs soaked in milk and pressed; two whole
eggs; three oz. of truffle peel; one-half oz. of salt, a pinch of
pepper, and a very little spice.</p>

<p>Sew up the tail, cover it with a piece of linen after the
manner of a galantine, and cook it gently for three hours in a
very light stock with vegetables as for boiled beef.</p>

<p>At the end of the three hours take it out of the linen; put it
into a sautépan, the bottom of which should be garnished as
for a braising; add a little of the cooking-liquor of the tail, and
complete the cooking, basting often the while. Take care to
baste more frequently towards the close of the operation with the
view of properly glazing the meat.</p>

<p>When about to serve, dish it, after having removed all
string, and lightly coat the bottom of the dish with a sauce
consisting of the cooking-liquor, reduced and thickened with
arrow-root. Send what remains of the cooking-liquor in a

<p>Cut the tail into sections twice the usual length, and cook
these in a stewpan for five hours with salted water and aromatics.</p>

<p>Drain the sections; dry them well; dip them in melted
butter, and roll them in very fine bread-crumbs. Sprinkle with
melted butter, and set to grill gently.</p>

<p>Grilled ox tail may be served with any vegetable purée. An
ordinary Soubise, or one prepared “à la Noailles,” as explained
under the piece of beef of that name, also suits very
well.</p>

<p>In any case, the Soubise should be sufficiently thick.</p>

<p>Such sauces as à la Diable, Hachée, Piquante, Robert,
Tomato, Italienne, &amp;c., are also suited to grilled ox tail.</p>

<p>N.B.—When the adjunct to grilled ox tail is a
<a id="png.404" href="#png.404"><span class="pagenum"><span

balls. Put the latter in a sautépan containing some boiling
beef cooking-liquor, which need not have been cleared of grease,
and let them poach for one and one-half hours.</p>

<p>Now drain the dumplings, and arrange them around the
meat with the garnish of carrots and turnips, as explained above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1167—Cold Salt Beef"><a id="rcp.1167"
 >1167—COLD SALT BEEF</a></h3>

<p>Salt beef, served cold, constitutes an excellent sideboard dish
for luncheons.</p>

<p>It need only be neatly trimmed all round, care being taken
to preserve all the fat so highly esteemed by some. Indeed, a
piece of cold salt fat is sometimes added to that already existing
around and in the meat, in which case the extra quantity is
fixed to the beef by means of a <i><a href="#g_hatelet">hatelet</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1168—Pressed Beef"><a id="rcp.1168"
 >1168—PRESSED BEEF</a></h3>

<p>Salt beef also serves in the preparation of “Pressed Beef,”
but, for this purpose, the breast is generally used.</p>

<p>After having thoroughly cooked the salted breast of beef in
accordance with the procedure indicated for salt beef, cut it into
large pieces of the same size as the moulds into which the meat
is going to be pressed. Lay the pieces of beef one on top of
another in a square or rectangular mould, and cover with a
thick board, cut flush with the inside edge of the mould. Now
apply pressure, either by means of a strong press or heavy
weight, and leave the beef to cool under the applied pressure.</p>

<p>When the meat is quite cold, turn it out; trim it carefully
on all sides, and glaze it, <i>i.e.</i>, cover it entirely with a coating
of rather firm, clarified gelatine, brought by means of carmine
and caramel to a nice red-brown colour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1169—Steak and Kidney Pudding"><a id="rcp.1169"
 >1169—STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>Cut three lbs. of very lean beef into slices one-third inch
thick.</p>

<p>Season these slices with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and add
a little chopped onion and parsley. Take a pudding-basin;
line it with a firm layer of suet-dough (No. <a href="#rcp.1166">1166</a>), and garnish
the bottom and sides of the basin with the slices of beef.</p>

<p>In the middle put one lb. of kidney of beef, of veal, or of
mutton, cut up as for tossing, and seasoned like the steaks.
Moisten with just sufficient water to cover.</p>

<p>Now close up the basin with a layer of the same paste as
that used in lining, pinching it with the latter, all round, that
it may adhere thoroughly. In order to effect this with greater
<a id="png.406" href="#png.406"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>388<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>certainty, the respective edges of the two layers of paste may
be moistened.</p>

<p>This done, cover the basin with a buttered and dredged
napkin, fastened on by means of string tied round just beneath
the lip of the utensil. Cook for five hours, either in boiling
water or in steam, and, after having removed the napkin, serve
the pudding as it stands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1170—Steak Pudding"><a id="rcp.1170"
 >1170—STEAK PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>Make some rather stiff paste with two lbs. of flour, one and
one-quarter lbs. of the chopped fat of kidney of beef, a pinch
of salt, and one-quarter pint of water.</p>

<p>With the rolling-pin, roll out this paste to a round layer
one-quarter inch thick, and put it into a buttered dome-mould
or pudding-basin.</p>

<p>Cut the lean beef into pieces, and season them, exactly as
for steak and kidney pudding. Fill up the basin with the
pieces arranged in layers; moisten with just enough water to
cover, and close up the basin with a layer of the same paste
as that used for its lining.</p>

<p>Carefully join the edges of the two layers of paste, assisting
the operation with a little moisture applied by means of a brush;
swathe the basin in a buttered pudding-cloth, and fasten the
latter firmly with string.</p>

<p>Put the pudding in a saucepan of boiling water or a steamer,
and leave it to cook for three hours if the beef has been cut
from the fillet, and for four hours if cut from any other piece.</p>

<p>At the end of the required time take the pudding out of the
saucepan and remove the cloth.</p>

 >1172—DAUBE CHAUDE <span class="nw">A LA PROVENÇALE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut four lbs. of shoulder or cushion of beef into cubes
weighing about four oz. each. Lard each piece of meat with
a strip of bacon two inches long by one-half inch wide, and
put the cubes or pieces into a bowl with salt, pepper, a very
little spice, five or six tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and a glass
of red wine. Leave to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for two or three hours, and
toss the pieces, from time to time, in the <i>marinading</i> liquor, in
order that each may be well saturated with it. Heat six oz. of

 </span></span></a>grated bacon in an earthenware stewpan, and brown therein
twelve small onions, fifteen carrots in the shape of olives, two
sticks of celery cut into pieces of the same size as the carrots,
and four cloves of garlic. Add the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> pieces of meat,
which should have been properly dried; fry the whole, meat
and vegetables, for a further seven or eight minutes, and
moisten with the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> and two glasses more of red wine.</p>

<p>Complete with one-half lb. of fresh bacon rind, <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> and
cut into square pieces of two-thirds inch side; a faggot made
up of parsley stalks, thyme, bay, and, in the centre, a small
piece of dry lemon rind. Set to boil, completely close the stewpan,
and leave to cook in a moderate oven for six or seven hours.</p>

<p>When about to serve, remove the faggot, clear all grease
from the gravy, and dish in a hot timbale, or serve the “daube”
in the stewpan itself.</p>

<p>A daube is rarely prepared specially for cold dishing; generally
the remains of one already served hot are used.</p>

<p>Take the pieces, one by one, with a fork, and place them in
a <i><a href="#g_terrine_2">terrine à pâté</a></i> with the carrots, onions, and squares of bacon
rind, which have remained almost untouched.</p>

<p>Strain the gravy over them through an ordinary strainer,
pressing lightly the while, and leave to cool.</p>

<p>When about to serve, turn out the daube on a cold dish, and
surround with chopped aspic jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1174—Carbonnades à la Flamande"><a id="rcp.1174"
 >1174—CARBONNADES <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut three lbs. of lean shoulder or cushion of beef into thin,
short slices. Season the latter with salt and pepper, and brown
them quickly on both sides in stock fat. At the same time toss
one and one-quarter lbs. of minced onions in butter, until they
are well browned.</p>

<p>Put the slices of beef and the onions in alternate layers into
a saucepan, and in their midst place a faggot.</p>

<p>Drain the grease from the sautépan in which the slices were
fried; swill with one and one-half pints of beer (old Lambic in
preference); add the same quantity of brown stock, thicken with
four oz. of brown roux; finish the seasoning with one and one-half oz. of powdered sugar; set to boil, stirring the while, and
strain this sauce over the slices of beef and the onions.</p>

<p>Cover and cook gently in the oven for from two and one-half
to three hours.</p>

<p>N.B.—Carbonnades<!-- TN: original reads "Carbonades" --> are served thus, mingled with the
onions; but they may also be dished in a timbale and covered

<h3 class="recipe" title="1175—Émincé de Bœuf"><a id="rcp.1175"
 >1175—ÉMINCÉ DE BŒUF</a></h3>

<p>Cold roast or boiled meats may be warmed up in many
different ways.</p>

<p>In their preparation, however, the reader should follow one
rule, the non-observance of which invariably leads to failure.</p>

<p>Whatever the meat be, it should first be cut into the thinnest
possible slices; set on a dish, and covered with a boiling sauce
or garnish, which should effect its warming up. If the meat
boil in the sauce or garnish, it toughens, and this, above all,
should be avoided when roast meat is used.</p>

<p>Sauces suited to <i>Émincés<!-- TN: first acute invisible --></i> are the Bordelaise, the Piquante,
the Italienne, the Chasseur, the Poivrade, the Périgueux, and
the Tomato.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1176—Émincé de Bœuf en Miroton"><a id="rcp.1176"
 >1176—ÉMINCÉ DE BŒUF EN MIROTON</a></h3>

<p>For one lb. of beef mince two fine onions somewhat finely,
and toss them in butter until they are evenly and well <i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i>.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of flour; set to cook
for a moment, and then moisten with one-half glassful of white
wine and one-half pint of consommé; season with a pinch of
pepper; boil, and leave to cook gently for seven or eight minutes.</p>

<p>The flour may be dispensed with, but, in this case, the white
wine is reduced to two-thirds, one-half pint of half-glaze is
added, and the whole is cooked for seven or eight minutes.</p>

<p>Cut the beef into very thin slices, and set these on a dish.</p>

<p>A minute before serving, add a few drops of vinegar to the
onions; cover the meat with the onions and the sauce; stand
the dish for a moment on the hob, and sprinkle it slightly
with chopped parsley.</p>

<p>N.B.—When the miroton is prepared with boiled beef, the
slices should be cut somewhat more thickly, and left to simmer
gently in the sauce for as long as possible<!-- TN: original reads "possble" -->—an hour or more if
necessary.</p>

<p>The miroton is then dished with some minced gherkins,
sprinkled with raspings, and placed in the oven at the last

in dice as there is pulp; two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion
cooked in butter per lb. of the preparation; a pinch of chopped
parsley, and a few drops of vinegar. Now toss the whole
together for a few minutes, and then fill the empty potato shells
with the preparation.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with Lyonnaise sauce rubbed through tammy, and
add as much of it as the hash will absorb.</p>

<p>Replace the portion of shell cut off at the first, that the

<h3 class="recipe" title="1180—Tripes à la Mode de Caen"><a id="rcp.1180"
 >1180—TRIPES <span class="nw">A LA MODE</span> DE CAEN</a></h3>

<p>In the preparation of this culinary speciality of Normandy,
a very common mistake is often made; to wit, that of using
calves’ feet instead of those of the ox, an innovation to which
there are many objections.</p>

<p><a id="png.410" href="#png.410"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>392<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In the first place, the gravy of the tripe cannot absorb so
much gelatine, and is indifferently thickened in consequence;
secondly, since calves’ feet are much more tender than those
of the ox, the former get boiled to shreds before the cooking of
the tripe has been properly effected. This supposed improvement
on the old method is thus seen to actually run counter to
the end in view; but means there are, nevertheless, whereby
those who insist upon the use of calves’ feet may be satisfied.
It is only necessary to braise a number of calves’ feet beforehand,
the number being in proportion to the quantity of tripe,
and to add these to the latter a quarter of an hour before
serving.</p>

<p>Another mistake which obtains somewhat widely in respect
of this dish is the serving of it in a silver utensil—a method
quite as unreasonable as that of serving a Chaudfroid in an
earthenware dish.</p>

<p>By virtue of its simplicity, tripe should be served in either
sandstone or special earthenware stewpans, wherein heat is best
retained; and the operator should rather direct his attention to
the serving of tripe as hot as possible, than to this or that
fanciful method of dishing, which really has no raison d’être
in this case.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of Tripe.</i>—Under the head of “beef tripe”
are understood: (1) The feet; (2) tripe proper, which comprises
the Paunch, the Honey-comb Bag, the Manyplies, and the
Reed.</p>

<p>First soak the tripe in cold water for some considerable
time; then cut it into squares of two inches side.</p>

<p>For the seasoning and flavouring of tripe, complete in all
its parts, take: (Seasoning) one-quarter oz. of salt and a pinch
of pepper per lb.; (flavouring) four lbs. of onions stuck with
four cloves; three lbs. of carrots; one faggot, comprising two lbs. of leeks, one-third lb. of parsley stalks, a sprig of thyme,
and a bay leaf.</p>

<p>Moisten with two quarts of good cider (not likely to turn
black while cooking, otherwise use water); one-half pint of
brandy or liqueur-cider.</p>

<p>The quantity of the moistening-liquor largely depends upon
the shape of the utensil; a little less will be needed in the case
of a narrow one, and a little more in the case of a wide one.</p>

<p>In any case, however, the tripe should be just covered.</p>

<p><i>Treatment and Cooking-process.</i>—Take a stewpan or braising-pan,
just large enough to hold the tripe and the garnish.</p>

<p>On the bottom of this lay carrots, onions, seasoning, and
the four ox feet, bound and cut into fair-sized pieces.</p>

<p><a id="png.411" href="#png.411"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>393<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Add the tripe, placing the faggot in its midst; upon the
tripe lay the bones of the feet, broken lengthwise; some slices
of beef-fat, well soaked in cold water; and, finally, the
moistening.</p>

<p>Cover the whole with a kind of <i><a href="#g_galette">galette</a></i> of paste, consisting
of flour mixed with hot water and kept somewhat stiff, and fix
the paste well on to the edges of the utensil.</p>

<p>Place in the oven, and, when about two hours have elapsed
and the paste is well baked, close the utensil with its own cover.</p>

<p>In a regular and moderate oven, allow about ten hours for
the cooking.</p>

<p><i>The Dishing and Serving.</i>—After taking the tripe out of
the oven, remove the cover of paste, the bones, the fat, the
carrots, the onions, and the faggot, and by means of a slice
withdraw the pieces of tripe and set them in the special earthenware
bowls, taking care to distribute the pieces, coming from
different portions of tripe, in such wise as to meet the demands
or fancies of the various consumers.</p>

<p>When the tripe has been transferred to the bowls, clear the
gravy of all grease, and dole it out evenly among the number
of receptacles. It is best, now, to put the latter in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>,
for they must only be served quite hot, on chafers or
otherwise.</p>

<p>N.B.—(1) To make the dish to perfection, the tripe should
be put into special earthenware pots (wherein the heat is more
effectively concentrated), and cooked in a baker’s or pastry-cook’s
oven.</p>

<p>I dealt with the alternative of cooking tripe in a stewpan
in order to make provision for those who can avail themselves
of neither special pots nor a baker’s oven.</p>

<p>(2) The measures I prescribe, namely, those of first laying
the slices of beef-fat upon the tripe, and then covering the
whole with a lid of paste, are intended to stop a too rapid
evaporation of the liquid—a contingency that must be guarded
against, more particularly in a kitchen oven—and to preserve
the whiteness of the tripe.</p>

<p>The cover of paste would be quite useless if a baker’s oven
were available, for the latter not only ensures perfectly regular
heat, but also wanes regularly.</p>

 ></span></span></a>2. VEAL.</h3><!-- TN: there does not appear to be a "1." heading to match this -->

<p>With the exception of veal sweetbreads, it cannot be denied
that this meat is considerably less popular in England than
abroad, nor does it ever seem to appear on important menus in
this country.</p>

<p>Of course, and the fact must not be lost sight of, English
veal is admittedly inferior in quality—badly fattened, and
mostly red, soft, and dry. Probably, therefore, its unpopularity
may be the indirect cause of its poor quality; for it is inconceivable
that a country so famous for cattle-rearing as England
undoubtedly is could not produce veal equal in quality to its
beef, mutton, and pork, if rearers thought it worth their while
to perfect that special branch of their business. Be this as it
may, almost all the best veal consumed in England comes from
the Continent, principally from France, Belgium, and Holland;
and, in this respect, I not only refer to the larger joints, but
to those odd parts such as the head, the liver, the sweetbreads, &amp;c., the continental quality of which is likewise very superior
to that of the English produce.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1181—Selle de Veau (Relevé)"><a id="rcp.1181"
 >1181—SELLE DE VEAU (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>Saddle of veal is the only Relevé of this meat which is
sometimes allowed to appear on an important menu, and it is,
in fact, a splendid and succulent joint.</p>

<p>It may be roasted, but I should urge the adoption of the
braising treatment, not only as a precaution against dryness,
but because of the fine stock yielded by the operation.</p>

<p>Whatever be the method of cooking, trim the saddle on one
side, flush with the bones of the pelvis, and up to the first
ribs on the other side. Then cut out the kidneys, leaving a
thick layer of fat on the under fillets or “filets mignons”;
pare the flank on either side, in such wise that what is left of
it, when drawn under the saddle on either side, may just cover
the fillets above referred to. This flank should only be drawn
over the fillets after the inside of the joint has been salted;
then cover the top surface of the joint with slices of bacon,
and tie round with string, five or six times, that the bacon
and the flank may not shift.</p>

<p>When the saddle is intended for only a small number of
people, half of it may be used at a time; that is to say, one
fillet, in which case the joint may be cut in two, lengthwise.</p>

<p>The procedure for braising this piece is in pursuance of the
directions given under “The Braising of White Meats” (No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>).</p>

<p><a id="png.413" href="#png.413"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>395<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The process of braising, whether it be in respect of the
saddle or other veal Relevés, such as the cushion, the loin, the
neck, &amp;c., demands particular care, must be accompanied by
frequent basting, and should always be carried on with short
moistening.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1182—Selle de Veau à la Chartreuse"><a id="rcp.1182"
 >1182—SELLE DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA CHARTREUSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the saddle, and glaze it at the last moment, after
having removed the slices of bacon. Set it on a long dish,
and, at each end of the latter, place a <i>chartreuse</i> of vegetables.</p>

<p>Round the joint put a few tablespoonfuls of the braising-liquor,
cleared of all grease, reduced, and well-strained; and
serve what remains in a sauceboat.</p>

<p><i>Chartreuses of Vegetables.</i>—Take two dome- or Charlotte-moulds,
capable of holding two-thirds of a quart. Butter them
liberally; line them with buttered paper, and on the latter, over
the bottom and sides of the utensil, lay carrots, turnips, peas,
and French beans; each of which vegetables should be cooked
in a way suited to its nature. This operation, which is somewhat
finicking, may either be effected on the plan of a draught-board,
or the different vegetables may be superposed in alternate
rows of varying colours.</p>

<p>When the moulds are garnished in this way, spread thereon,
over the vegetables, a layer of forcemeat softened with beaten
white of egg; the object of this measure is to keep the vegetable
decoration in position, and this is effected by the poaching of
the forcemeat before the chartreuse is filled with its garnish.</p>

<p>This done, fill the moulds to within one-third inch of their
brims with a <a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a> of vegetables cohered by means of
stiff Béchamel and cream, and cover with a layer of forcemeat.</p>

<p>Set these chartreuses to poach thirty-five minutes before
serving, and take care to let them rest for five minutes before
unmoulding them on either side of the saddle.</p>

 >1183—SELLE DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA METTERNICH</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the saddle, and, when it is ready, put it on a dish.
Now draw a line within one-half inch of its extreme edge on
either side and end, pressing the point of a small knife along
the meat in so doing.</p>

<p>Proceed in the same way on either side of the chine, and
remove the fillets from the joint, severing them from the bone
with care.</p>

<p>Cut the fillets into regular collops, keeping the knife somewhat
at a slant.</p>

<p>In the double cavity left by the fillets spread a few tablespoonfuls
of Béchamel with paprika; return the colloped fillets
<a id="png.414" href="#png.414"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>396<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to their respective places in the joint, reconstructing them in
such wise as to make them appear untouched; and between
the collops pour one-half tablespoonful of Béchamel and lay
two slices of truffle.</p>

<p>This done, cover the whole surface of the joint with
Béchamel sauce with paprika, and set to glaze quickly at the
salamander. Now, with a large slice, carefully transfer the
saddle to a dish.</p>

<p>Serve separately (1) the braising-liquor of the saddle, cleared
of all grease and reduced; (2) a timbale of pilaff rice.</p>

<p>Braise the saddle. When it is ready, remove the fillets,
proceeding exactly as described under “Selle à la Metternich,”
and cut the fillets in a similar manner.</p>

<p>In the cavities left by the fillets spread a few tablespoonfuls
of Soubise; return the colloped fillets to their place, and,
between the collops, place a thin slice of ham, of the same size
and shape as the adjacent piece of meat, and a little Soubise
sauce.</p>

<p>Having reconstructed the joint, cover its surface with a
layer, about one inch thick, of “<a href="#rcp.2295a">Soufflé au Parmesan</a>,” combined
with one quart of truffle purée.</p>

<p>Bind the joint with a strong band of buttered paper, for the
purpose of holding in the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i>, and set it to cook in a
moderate oven for fifteen minutes. After having taken the
saddle out of the oven, remove the paper band, and send it to
the table without changing the dish.</p>

<p>Send the braising-liquor, cleared of all grease, reduced and

<p>Prepare twenty studs of truffle, about one inch long and
one-third oz. in weight. Stick them upright and symmetrically
into the meat of the joint, making way for them by means of
little incisions cut with a small knife. Now envelop the joint
in slices of larding bacon, string it, braise it, and glaze it at
the last moment.</p>

<p>Dish it with some of its braising-liquor, cleared of all grease

<h3 class="recipe" title="1192—Selle de Veau Froide"><a id="rcp.1192"
 >1192—SELLE DE VEAU FROIDE</a></h3>

<p>Cold saddle of veal makes an excellent sideboard dish which
admits of all cold-dish garnishes, such as <a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoines</a> of vegetables
cohered with jelly or mayonnaise sauce; artichoke-bottoms
and tomatoes, variously garnished; small, moulded
vegetable salads, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Decorate it with fine, regular, jelly dice; but its usual and
essential adjunct is its own braising-liquor, cooked, cleared of
grease poured carefully away, and served in a sauceboat without
having been either clarified or cleared.</p>

<p>All the pieces of veal given as relevés, the cushion, the loin,
the fillet, and the fricandeau, may be served cold like the saddle,
and are generally much appreciated, more particularly in
summer.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1197—Cushion of Veal (Relevés)"><a id="rcp.1197"
 >1197—CUSHION OF VEAL (Relevés)</a></h3>

<p>I have grouped these various Relevés together owing to
the identicalness of their garnishes.</p>

<p>The directions I give below for cushion of veal are, with a
very few exceptions which I shall point out, applicable to all
other large veal joints. In the circumstances, therefore, it
would be quite unnecessary to repeat the recipe in each case.</p>

<p><a id="png.417" href="#png.417"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>399<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i>Loin of Veal</i> is that piece which corresponds with the sirloin
in beef. It extends from the floating ribs to the extreme end
of the haunch, the latter being cut flush with the pelvic bone
at its junction with the femur, and following the direction of
the former bone. The loin thus consists of two distinct <span class="nw">parts:—</span>(1) the caudal region (called the chump end; Fr. quasi), which
comprises the bones of the pelvis and the haunch, up to the
level of the latter, and is one of the best pieces of veal for
braising; and (2) the region extending from the haunch to the
floating ribs, comprising the fillet and the upper fillet. This
last portion also constitutes a choice joint, to which the kidneys
are generally left attached, after all their superfluous fat has
been removed.</p>

<p><i>Neck or Best End of Veal</i> consists of the first eight or nine
ribs, cut two inches above the kernel of meat. The ends of the
rib-bones are cleared of meat to a height of about two-thirds
inch, and the naked bone is then called the “handle” of the
cutlet, which ultimately holds the ornamental frill of paper.</p>

<p>The vertebræ are then suppressed, so that the bones of the
ribs alone remain; the yellow ligament is cut away; and the
bared parts are covered with slices of bacon, tied on by means
of string.</p>

<p><i>Cushion of Veal</i> consists of an enormous muscle, which
represents almost half of the haunch and all the inside part of
it, from the pelvis to its junction with the tibia. A certain
quantity of white fat will always be found to lie over the cushion,
and it should be carefully reserved.</p>

<p>If the cushion is to be larded, a procedure which I do not
advise, it should be done on the bared part adjoining the fat-covered
region.</p>

<p>The various pieces of veal enumerated above may be roasted,
but, as in the case of the saddle, I prefer braising, owing to
the greater succulence of the dish resulting from this process,
and its accompanying gravy, which has an incomparable
flavour. (See Braising of White Meats, No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>.)</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1198—Adjuncts to Cushion of Veal"><a id="rcp.1198"
 >1198—ADJUNCTS TO CUSHION OF VEAL</a></h3>

<p>Cushion of veal, like the other large pieces of veal, admits
of an almost unlimited number of vegetable garnishes, simple
or compound, as also garnishes of various pastes.</p>

<p>From among these garnishes the following may be quoted,
<span class="nw">viz.:—</span>Bouquetière, Bourgeoise, <a href="#g_chartreuse">Chartreuse</a>, Choisy, Chicorée,
Cardoons, Clamart, Braised Celery, Japanese Artichokes,
Chow-chow, Endives, Spinach, Braised Lettuce, à la Vichy,
à la Nemours, &amp;c.; Jardinière, <a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a>, Renaissance, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="png.418" href="#png.418"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>400<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Among the paste <span class="nw">garnishes:—</span>Noodles, Macaroni, Spaghetti,
variously prepared; various Gnocchi, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And, in addition to all these, the garnishes already given
under Beef Relevés, which need not be repeated here.</p>

<p>I shall, therefore, give only three recipes which are proper
to cushion of veal; though even these should be regarded as
mere curiosities, seeing that, far from recommending them, I
consider them rather as gastronomical mistakes. But some
provision must be made for outlandish tastes, and, for this
reason alone, I include the following recipes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1199—Noix de Veau en Surprise"><a id="rcp.1199"
 >1199—NOIX DE VEAU EN SURPRISE</a></h3>

<p>Braise the cushion of veal, keeping it somewhat firm. This
done, set it on a dish, and let it almost cool.</p>

<p>Then cut a slice from it laterally, at a point one-third inch
of its height from the top; and, within one-half inch of its
edges, make a circular incision, pressing the point of a sharp
knife into the meat, and withdraw the centre of the cushion.
Take care to leave the same thickness of meat on the sides as
on the bottom, that is to say, about one-half inch. The cushion
of veal, thus emptied, should have the appearance of a round
or oval case.</p>

<p>If the meat withdrawn from the centre of the cushion is to
serve for the garnish, or is to be used sliced to surround the
case, cut it from out the whole in the largest possible pieces, in
order that slices may easily be cut therefrom.</p>

<p>The inside of the emptied cushion of veal is then garnished
according to fancy; the top of the piece that was cut off at the
start is returned to its place, with the view of giving the piece
an untouched appearance, and the whole is put in the oven for
a few minutes that it may be hot for serving.</p>

<p>The braising-liquor, cleared of grease and strained, should
be sent to the table separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1200—Noix de Veau en Surprise à la Macédoine"><a id="rcp.1200"
 >1200—NOIX DE VEAU EN SURPRISE <span class="nw">A LA MACÉDOINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the cushion of veal, and hollow it out as explained
above.</p>

<p>Meanwhile (1) prepare a <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i> garnish, or mixed <i>Jardinière</i>
(cohered with butter or cream), the quantity of which
should be in proportion to the size of the case; (2) cut the
meat, withdrawn from the centre of the cushion, into thin
rectangles.</p>

<p>Garnish the bottom of the case with a layer of <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i>,
and set thereon a litter consisting of the rectangles of meat.
Cover with <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->; set thereon another litter of the pieces
<a id="png.419" href="#png.419"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>401<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of meat, and renew the operation until the case is filled. Finish
up with a layer of <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i>.</p>

<p>Replace the slice cut from the cushion at the start; put the
case in the oven for a few minutes; serve, and send the braising-liquor
separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1201—Noix de Veau en Surprise à la Pithiviers"><a id="rcp.1201"
 >1201—NOIX DE VEAU EN SURPRISE <span class="nw">A LA PITHIVIERS</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the cushion of veal, and prepare the case as directed
above.</p>

<p>Stuff fifteen larks without boning them; that is to say, put
a lump of stuffing about the size of a hazel-nut into each. Fry
them in butter with one-half lb. of mushrooms and three oz.
of truffles, each of which vegetables should be raw and minced.
Cohere the whole with the necessary quantity of half-glaze sauce,
flavoured with game essence; put this garnish in the case;
return the sliced piece to its place; seal the cover to the case
by means of a thread of almost liquid forcemeat, and set in the
oven for seven or eight minutes.</p>

<p>When taking the case out of the oven, surround with the
withdrawn meat, which should have been cut into thin slices
and kept warm until required for the dressing.</p>

<p>The larks may be replaced by quails or thrushes, or other
small birds, but the name of the particular bird used must be
referred to in the title of the dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1202—Noix de Veau en Surprise à la Toulousaine"><a id="rcp.1202"
 >1202—NOIX DE VEAU EN SURPRISE <span class="nw">A LA TOULOUSAINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the cushion and cut it to the shape of a case as
explained above. Pour therein a garnish consisting of quenelles
of chicken forcemeat; lamb sweetbreads, or collops of veal
sweetbreads, braised without colouration; cocks’ combs; small
mushrooms, cooked and very white; and slices of truffle; the
whole to be cohered by means of an Allemande sauce, flavoured
with mushroom essence.</p>

<p>Return the piece sliced off at the start to its place, and surround
with slices of the meat withdrawn from the inside of
the cushion.</p>

<p>N.B.—All the garnishes suited to Vol-au-vent and timbales
may be served with cushion-of-veal case, which latter thus
stands in the stead of the Vol-au-vent and Timbale crusts.</p>

<p>Finally, I must ask the reader to bear in mind that methods
like those described above have no place in really good cookery,
the ruling principle of which should always be simplicity.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1203—Noix de Veau Froide à la Caucasienne"><a id="rcp.1203"
 >1203—NOIX DE VEAU FROIDE <span class="nw">A LA CAUCASIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut a cold cushion of veal into slices two inches long by
one-half inch wide by one-sixth inch thick.</p>

<p><a id="png.420" href="#png.420"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>402<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>On each slice spread a little butter seasoned with salt and
pepper, combined with finely-chopped chives and anchovy fillets
cut into dice.</p>

<p>Couple the slices together as for sandwiches; round off their
angles and put them under slight pressure. Prepare a Purée
of tomatoes with jelly; mould it in a dome- or Bombe-mould,
and let it set on ice.</p>

<p>When this moulding of tomatoes is quite firm, turn it out
in the middle of a round, cold dish; arrange the meat slices all
round, and border the dish with cubes of very clear veal jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1204—Noix de Veau Froide à la Suédoise"><a id="rcp.1204"
 >1204—NOIX DE VEAU FROIDE <span class="nw">A LA SUÉDOISE</span></a></h3>

<p>(1) From the widest part of a cold cushion of veal, cut a
lateral slice one and one-third inch thick, and trim it nicely
round.</p>

<p>(2) Let a coating of aspic jelly set on the bottom of a round
dish, and upon this jelly, when it is quite firm, lay the slice
of veal.</p>

<p>(3) Cut what remains of the piece of veal into slices two
inches long, by one and one-half inch broad, by one-eighth inch
thick. Prepare the same number of rectangles of salted tongue,
of the same size, though slightly thinner than those of veal.</p>

<p>(4) Cohere a nice vegetable salad with cleared mayonnaise;
mould it in an oiled, Bombe-shaped or narrow pyramid mould,
and put it on ice to set.</p>

<p>Coat the rectangles of veal with horse-radish butter; place
a rectangle of tongue on each, and finish off these sandwiches
by rounding their corners.</p>

<p><i>For Dishing.</i>—By means of a piping-bag fitted with a
grooved pipe, garnish the edges of the slice of veal with a
thread of previously softened butter.</p>

<p>Turn out the vegetable salad in the centre of the piece of
meat; set on it the heart of a small lettuce (nicely opened), and
arrange the veal and tongue sandwiches all round.</p>

<p>Serve a cold sauce, derived from the mayonnaise, separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1205—Longes, Carrés et Noix de Veau Froids"><a id="rcp.1205"
 >1205—LONGES, CARRÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible --> ET NOIX DE VEAU FROIDS</a></h3>

<p>What was said in respect of cold saddle of veal likewise
applies to the different pieces mentioned in the above title.
They may be coated with aspic jelly and dished with <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoines</a></i>
of vegetables, cohered with jelly; small salads, cohered
with cleared mayonnaise; garnished artichoke-bottoms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The dishes should always be bordered with cubes of very
clear jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1206—Fricandeau (Relevé)"><a id="png.421" href="#png.421"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>403<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.1206"
 >1206—FRICANDEAU (Relevé)</a></h3>

<p>Fricandeau is a lateral cut from the cushion of veal; that is
to say, a piece cut with the grain of the meat. It should not be
thicker than one and one-half inches.</p>

<p>After beating it with a beater or the flat of a chopper, to
break the fibres of the meat, finely lard the piece of meat on the
cut side with strips of bacon, somewhat smaller than those used
for fillet of beef. Only when the piece is larded may it be
called “Fricandeau”; for, when not treated thus, it is nothing
else than an ordinary piece of veal. Fricandeau is invariably
braised; but it differs from other braisings of white meat in this,
namely, that it must be so cooked as to be easily cut with a
spoon. Connoisseurs maintain that Fricandeau should never
be touched with a knife.</p>

<p>It is glazed at the last moment, like other braisings, and,
in view of its prolonged cooking, should be dished with great
care.</p>

<p>All the garnishes enumerated for cushion of veal may be
adapted to Fricandeau.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1207—Fricandeau Froid"><a id="rcp.1207"
 >1207—FRICANDEAU FROID</a></h3>

<p>Cold fricandeau constitutes an excellent luncheon dish. It
is dished and surrounded with its braising-liquor, cleared of
grease and strained. This braising-liquor sets to a jelly, and
is the finest adjunct to fricandeau that could be found.</p>

<p>The piece may be glazed with half-melted jelly, smeared
over it by means of a brush.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1208—Poitrine de Veau Farcie"><a id="rcp.1208"
 >1208—POITRINE DE VEAU FARCIE</a></h3>

<p>This is really a family dish, admirably suited for a luncheon
relevé. It is accompanied chiefly by vegetable purées, but all
the vegetable and other garnishes given under Cushion of Veal
may be served with it.</p>

<p>Breast of veal is prepared <span class="nw">thus:—</span>After having boned the
piece, open it where it is thickest, without touching the ends.
A kind of pocket is thus obtained, into which put the previously-prepared
stuffing, taking care to spread it very evenly.</p>

<p>Now, with coarse cotton, sew up the opening, and remember
to withdraw the cotton when the piece is cooked.</p>

<p><i>Stuffing for Breast of Veal.</i>—For a piece weighing four lbs., add to one lb. of very fine sausage-meat (No. <a href="#rcp.196">196</a>), two oz. of dry <i>duxelles</i>, two oz. of butter, a pinch of chopped
parsley, tarragon and chives, a small beaten egg, and a little
salt and pepper.</p>

<p><i>Cooking.</i>—Breast of veal is usually braised; the moistening
<a id="png.422" href="#png.422"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>404<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>should be short and the cooking process gentle. For a piece
weighing four lbs. when stuffed, allow three hours in a moderate
and regular oven. Glaze breast of veal at the last moment, as
in the case of other braised meats.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1209—Tête de Veau (Relevé and Entrée)"><a id="rcp.1209"
 >1209—TÊTE DE VEAU (Relevé and Entrée)</a></h3>

<p>Nowadays, calf’s head is rarely served whole, as was the
custom formerly. Still more rarely, however, is it served at
a dinner of any importance; and it has now, by almost general
consent, been relegated to luncheon menus where, indeed, it
has found its proper place.</p>

<p>After having boned the head, soak it or hold it under a
running tap, for a sufficiently long time to allow of its being
entirely cleared of blood. Then, <a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a> it for a good half-hour;
cool it in cold water; drain it, and rub it with a piece of lemon
to avoid its blackening.</p>

<p>If it is to be cooked whole, as sometimes happens, wrap it in
a napkin, that it may be easily handled; if not, cut it into pieces.
In either case, plunge it immediately into a boiling <i>blanc</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.167">167</a>).</p>

<p>With a view of keeping the calf’s head from contact with
the air, which would blacken it, cover it with a napkin, or
cover the liquid with chopped suet. A layer of chopped suet
is the best possible means of keeping the air from the calf’s
head.</p>

<p>Whatever be the method of serving calf’s head, it is the
rule to send slices of tongue and collops of brain to the table
with it.</p>

<p>The tongue may be cooked simultaneously with the head, and
the brain is poached as described under No. <a href="#rcp.1289">1289</a>.</p>

<p>Calf’s head <i>à l’anglaise</i> is cooked in a <i>blanc</i>, as explained
above; but in halves and unboned.</p>

<p>Dish it on a napkin with sprays of very green parsley and
a piece of boiled bacon.</p>

<p>Send a sauceboat of parsley sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.119a">119a</a>) to the table at
the same time.</p>

<p>Cook the calf’s head in a <i>blanc</i> as already directed. Suppress
portions of the meat, where the latter is thick, in such wise
as to leave only a very little on the skin.</p>

<p>Cut off<!-- TN: second "f" invisible --> pieces into squares of one, two or three in. side;
<a id="png.423" href="#png.423"><span class="pagenum"><span

 >1212—TÊTE DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA POULETTE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook the calf’s head in a <i>blanc</i>.</p>

<p>Cut the pieces of the head into small slices, somewhat aslant,
and toss them into a previously-prepared poulette sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.101">101</a>).</p>

<p>Dish in a timbale, and sprinkle with a pinch of chopped
parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1213—Tête de Veau en Tortue"><a id="rcp.1213"
 >1213—TÊTE DE VEAU EN TORTUE</a></h3>

<p>With a round cutter one, two, or three in. in diameter, cut
up the pieces of calf’s head, the meat of which must be entirely
suppressed. For this preparation, only the skin of the head
should be used.</p>

<p>Put the pieces of head in a timbale or on a dish, and cover
them with a Tortue garnish.</p>

<p><i>Tortue garnish consists of</i>: Small quenelles of veal forcemeat
with butter; cock’s combs and kidneys; small mushrooms;
stoned, stuffed and poached olives; slices of truffle; gherkins
cut to the shape of olives (these should only be put into the
sauce at the last moment); and Tortue sauce.</p>

<p>This garnish comprises, besides, among unsauced ingredients:
Slices of tongue and calf’s brain; small, trussed crayfish,
cooked in <i>court-bouillon</i>; fried eggs, the half of whose raw
whites should be suppressed; and small <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumb,

 >1214—TÊTE DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA VINAIGRETTE</span> OU <span class="nw">A L’HUILE</span></a></h3>

<p>Set the boiling pieces of calf’s head on a napkin, lying on
a dish. Surround them with slices of tongue, collops of brain,
and sprigs of very green, curled-leaf parsley.</p>

<p>Serve separately, on a hors-d’œuvre dish, without mixing
them, capers, chopped onion and parsley.</p>

<p>Send to the table at the same time a sauceboat of vinaigrette
or sauce à l’huile, prepared by mixing one part of
vinegar, two parts of oil, and one part of the calf’s-head
cooking-liquor, together with the necessary salt and pepper.</p>

 >1215—ESCALOPES DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Collops of veal may be cut from either the fillet or the
saddle; but they are more often cut from the cushion. Their
weight varies from three to four oz., and they should always
be cleared of all connective tissue. They may be fashioned
to the shape of ovals, or curve-based triangles, and they should
<a id="png.424" href="#png.424"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>406<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be more or less flattened, according to their use. Thus, when
they are to be plainly tossed, to be afterwards served with a
sauced garnish or with a sauce, they are simply beaten in order
to break the fibres of the meat, without flattening the latter
too much; but if, on the contrary, they are to be treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à
l’anglaise</i></a>, they should be beaten very thin with the moistened
beater.</p>

<p>In either case, they should be cooked somewhat quickly in
clarified butter; for, if their cooking lag at all, their meat
hardens.</p>

<p>All the garnishes of veal cutlets, and a large number of
those of the cushion, may be served with the collops. These
garnishes may be set on the same dish with the collops when
the latter are plainly tossed; but, in the case of collops treated
<a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, the garnish or sauce which accompanies them
should be served separately, lest its moisture soften the crisp
coating of the collops.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1216—Grenadins"><a id="rcp.1216"
 >1216—GRENADINS</a></h3>

<p>Grenadins are veal collops larded with rows of very thin
bacon strips, and cut somewhat thicker than ordinary collops.
They are really small fricandeaux, the braising of which is a
comparatively lengthy operation; for their cooking must be the
same as that of the fricandeaux, and needs quite as much attention.
In order that the grenadins be not too dry, they should
be frequently basted with their braising-liquor.</p>

<p>When they are cooked, glaze them rapidly, and dish them
with one of the garnishes given for the cushion of veal.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1217—Grenadins Froids en Bellevue"><a id="rcp.1217"
 >1217—GRENADINS FROIDS EN BELLEVUE</a></h3>

<p>This dish may be prepared in several more or less complicated
ways; here is a simple <span class="nw">way:—</span></p>

<p>Take as many shell-shaped hors-d’œuvre dishes as there are
grenadins. Let a thin coat of jelly set on the bottom of each,
and set thereon a slight decoration composed of bits of carrot,
turnip, peas, French beans in lozenge-form, &amp;c. Put a grenadin,
larded side undermost (<i>i.e.</i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->, upside down) into each hors-d’œuvre
dish; add enough melted aspic jelly to reach half-way
up the thickness of the grenadin.</p>

<p>When this jelly has set, lay on it, all round the grenadin,
a border consisting of carrots, turnips, French beans and peas.
Sprinkle these vegetables with a few drops of jelly, so as to
fix them, and keep them from floating, and then fill up the
hors-d’œuvre dishes with jelly.</p>

<p>When about to serve, dip the hors-d’œuvre dishes into hot
<a id="png.425" href="#png.425"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>407<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>water; turn out the grenadins on a very cold dish, and arrange
them on it to form a crown.</p>

<p>Surround with a border of very clear, chopped aspic jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1218—Ris de Veau (Sweetbreads)"><a id="rcp.1218"
 >1218—RIS DE VEAU (Sweetbreads)</a></h3>

<p>Veal sweetbreads may be looked upon as one of the greatest
delicacies in butchers’ meats, and may be served at any dinner,
however sumptuous. Select them very white, entirely free of
blood stains, and leave them to soak in fresh water, which
should be frequently changed, for as long as possible; or, better
still, place them under a running tap.</p>

<p>To <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a></i> them (an operation the purpose of which is to
harden the surface) put them in a saucepan with enough cold
water to cover them completely, and bring to the boil gently.
Let them boil for ten minutes; withdraw them and plunge them
into a basin of fresh water.</p>

<p>When the sweetbreads are cold, trim them; that is to say,
cut away all cartilaginous and connective tissue; lay them
between two pieces of linen, and put them under a light weight
for two hours.</p>

<p>Now lard them with fine bacon, tongue or truffle, subject to
the way in which they are to be served. They may also be
studded with either tongue or truffles, or they may be left
unlarded and unstudded, and plainly braised, just as they are.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that neither studding nor larding enhances in
any way whatsoever their quality or sightliness.</p>

<p>Veal sweetbread consists of two parts, as unequal in quality
as in shape. They are: the “kernel” or heart sweetbread,
which is the round and most delicate part, and the “throat,”
or throat sweetbread, which is the elongated part, and not of
such fine quality as the former.</p>

<p>In a well-ordered dinner, heart sweetbreads only should be
used, as far as possible.</p>

<p>There are three ways of cooking sweetbreads, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span>Braising
(No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>), poaching (No. <a href="#rcp.249">249</a>), and grilling (No. <a href="#rcp.259">259</a>). In the
following recipes, therefore, the reader will kindly refer to the
directions given under one of the numbers just mentioned,
according as to whether the dish is to be a braising, a poaching,
or a grill.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1219—Attereaux de Ris de Veau à la Villeroy" id="g_attereaux"><a id="rcp.1219"
 >1219—ATTEREAUX DE RIS DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA VILLEROY</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut some veal sweetbreads (preferably the throat kind) into
roundels one and one-third in. in diameter and one-third in.
thick. Prepare an equal number of mushrooms and truffle
roundels, somewhat thinner than those of sweetbread.</p>

<p><a id="png.426" href="#png.426"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>408<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Impale these roundels on little wooden skewers, the size of
matches, and about four in. long; alternating the different
products in so doing. Dip these skewers into a Villeroy sauce,
and set them on a dish. When the sauce is quite cold, remove
the attereaux; clear them of any superfluous sauce that may
have fallen on to the dish; dip them in an <i>anglaise</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.174">174</a>);
roll them in very fine and fresh bread-crumbs, and turn them
with the fingers, so as to shape them like small cylinders.
Plunge them into plenty of hot fat eight minutes before serving;
drain them on a piece of linen; carefully withdraw the wooden
skewers and put little silver ones in their place. Dish the
attereaux on a folded napkin, with fried parsley in the centre;
or set them upright in a circle, on a rice or semolina cushion
lying on a dish, and put some very green, fried parsley in the
middle.</p>

<p>Serve a Périgueux sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1220—Chartreuse de Ris de Veau" id="g_chartreuse"><a id="rcp.1220"
 >1220—CHARTREUSE DE RIS DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Prepare (1) one and one-quarter lbs. of fine forcemeat with
cream (No. <a href="#rcp.194">194</a>); (2) two poached, veal throat sweetbreads, cut
into slices; (3) one-half lb. of cooked mushrooms, cut into
large slices, and three oz. of sliced truffles; (4) a garnish of
carrots and turnips, raised by means of a tube- or spoon-cutter,
or cut into grooved roundels two-thirds inch in diameter; and
peas and French beans. Each of these vegetables should be
cooked in a way befitting its nature, and kept somewhat firm.</p>

<p>Liberally butter a quart Charlotte-mould. Line its bottom
and sides with the vegetables, arranged in alternate and vari-coloured
rows, and spread thereon a layer of forcemeat, one-half
inch thick.</p>

<p>This done, set upon the layer of forcemeat just spread,
another of slices of sweetbread, mushrooms, and truffles; cover
the whole with a coat of forcemeat; start the operation again
with a litter of sweetbread, mushroom, and truffle slices, and
proceed as before until the mould is filled. Finish with a layer
of forcemeat. Cover with a round piece of buttered paper, and
set to poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> and in the oven, for from forty-five
to fifty minutes.</p>

<p>When taking the <i>chartreuse</i> out of the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, let it
stand for seven or eight minutes, that the ingredients inside
may settle a little, and then turn it out in the middle of a
round dish; place a large, cooked, grooved, and very white
mushroom on the top of it, and encircle its base with a crown
of small braised and well-trimmed half-lettuces.</p>

<p><a id="png.427" href="#png.427"><span class="pagenum"><span

manner described under No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>, and moisten with excellent
veal stock. Take particular care of the vegetables, that they
do not burn.</p>

<p>When the sweetbreads are ready, glaze them and dish them
in a shallow, round <i>cocotte</i> with the <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of vegetables and
the braising-liquor all round.</p>

<p>Cover the <i>cocotte</i>, and serve it on a folded napkin.</p>

<p>Butter an ordinary round hot raised pie, or a Charlotte-mould.
Take about one and one-half lbs. of short paste and
roll it into <i><a href="#g_galette">galettes</a></i>, one-third inch thick; fold the paste over
after having dredged it slightly; draw the two ends gently
towards the centre, to form a kind of skullcap, which, when
placed in the mould, immediately lines the latter. Avoid making
folds in the paste while preparing the skullcap, for they would
spoil the look of the patty when turned out.</p>

<p>Press the paste on the bottom and sides of the mould, that
the latter may impart its shape to its lining, and cut the projecting
paste to within half inch of the brim. Now coat the
bottom and sides of the mould with a layer of chicken forcemeat,
of an even thickness of two-thirds of an inch.</p>

<p>Pour into the centre of the mould a garnish composed of
slices of poached veal sweetbread; sliced and cooked mushrooms
and sliced truffles; the whole covered with reduced and
somewhat stiff Allemande sauce, flavoured with mushroom
essence.</p>

<p>Cover the garnish with a coating of forcemeat, and close
the patty with a layer of paste, the edges of which should be
moistened and sealed down all round the brim of the mould.
Pinch the rim of paste inside and outside, and finish off with
leaves of paste stamped out with a fancy-cutter, ribbed by means
of the back of a knife, and laid upon the paste cover. <i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i> with
beaten egg; make a central slit for the escape of steam, and set
to bake in a hot oven, for from forty-five to fifty minutes.</p>

<p>When taking the patty out of the oven, turn it out and dish
it on a napkin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1242—Timbale de Ris de Veau"><a id="rcp.1242"
 >1242—TIMBALE DE RIS DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Butter a timbale mould and decorate its sides with thin pieces
of noodle paste, in the shape of lozenges, crescents, indented
rings, discs and imitation-leaves. Excellent ornamental
arrangements may be effected thus; but the reader should bear
in mind that the simplest are the best.</p>

<p>Prepare a skullcap of paste as explained under No. <a href="#rcp.1241">1241</a>;
<a id="png.433" href="#png.433"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>415<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slightly moisten the ornamental work in the mould, that it may
cling to the paste of the timbale, and line the latter with paste
which should be well pressed in all directions, that it may take
the shape of the mould.</p>

<p>Then pierce the paste on the bottom, to prevent its blistering
during the baking process; line the bottom and sides with
buttered paper, and fill the timbale, three-quarters full, with
split peas or lentils.</p>

<p>Cover the latter with a round piece of paper, and close the
timbale by means of a round layer of paste, which should be
sealed down round the edges. Make and trim the crest of the
timbale; pinch it inside and out, and finish the cover, by means
of applied imitation-leaves of paste, superposed to form a kind
of dome.</p>

<p>Set in a moderate oven, and when the timbale is baked,
remove its cover with the view of withdrawing the lentils or
peas and the paper, the sole object of which was to provide
a support for the cover. Besmear the inside of the timbale with
a brush dipped in the beaten white of an egg; keep it for a
minute or two in front of the oven, with the view of drying
it inside; turn it out, and spread upon its bottom and sides a
very thin coat of chicken or ordinary forcemeat, the purpose
of which is to shield the crust from the softening effects of the
juices of the garnish.</p>

<p>Put the timbale in the front of the oven for a moment or
two, that this coating of forcemeat may poach.</p>

<p><i>Garnish.</i>—Veal sweetbreads, braised without colouration
and cut into collops; small mushrooms; cocks’ combs and
kidneys; small quenelles of chicken, <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat, or
roundels of chicken forcemeat rolls one-third inch thick, trimmed
with the fancy-cutter; and slices of truffles, half of which should
be kept for the purposes of decoration.</p>

<p>Cover this garnish with Allemande sauce, prepared with
mushroom essence. Pour it into the timbale, just before
serving; upon it set the reserved slices of truffle, in the form of
a crown; replace the cover; dish upon a folded napkin, and
serve.</p>

<p>N.B. (1) As already stated the garnish of the timbale may be
cohered with a half-glaze sauce, flavoured with Madeira or
truffle essence.</p>

<p>(2) In this garnish, whether it be cohered by means of a
white or brown sauce, the slices of veal sweetbreads are always
the principal ingredient; but, subject to the circumstances, the
other details may be altered or modified.</p>

 >1243—VOL AU VENT DE RIS DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Vol au vent, which formerly held the place of honour on
bourgeois menus, has now fallen somewhat into the background;
nevertheless, I wished it to appear among the recipes
in this work.</p>

<p><i>The preparation of the paste</i>: Make the vol au vent crust
as explained under No. <a href="#rcp.2390">2390</a>.</p>

<p><i>Garnish.</i>—Prepare it exactly as explained under “Timbale
de ris de Veau.” This garnish may also be cohered with a
brown sauce, and its minor ingredients may be modified; but
the slices of veal sweetbread must always stand as the dominating
element.</p>

<p>Whatever be the selected kind of garnish, vol au vent should
always be accompanied by medium-sized, trussed crayfish,
cooked in <i>court-bouillon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dishing.</i>—Set the vol au vent crust upon a dish covered with
a napkin; pour the garnish into it; decorate with slices of
truffle; arrange the crayfish round the edge, and lay the cover
upon the crayfish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1244—Ris de Veau à la Richelieu"><a id="rcp.1244"
 >1244—RIS DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA RICHELIEU</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the veal sweetbreads exactly as described under “Ris
de Veau Bonne Maman,” taking care to keep the braising-liquor
sufficiently plentiful to well cover the sweetbreads in the
<i>cocotte</i>.</p>

<p>When the sweetbreads are in the <i>cocotte</i>, together with the
<i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of vegetables and a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of truffles, strain the
braising-liquor over the whole; leave to cool well, and, when
the liquid has turned to a jelly, remove the grease that has
risen to the surface.</p>

<p>Dish the <i>cocotte</i> on a napkin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1245—Ris de Veau à la Suédoise"><a id="rcp.1245"
 >1245—RIS DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA SUÉDOISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Poach the veal sweetbreads without colouration, and, when
they are quite cold, cut them into thin and regular collops.
Spread some horse-radish butter over the latter, and cover with
a slice of tongue of the same size as the underlying collop.</p>

<p>Bake a crust without colouration in a flawn ring, of a size
in proportion to the number of slices, and garnish it with a
vegetable salad cohered with mayonnaise. This crust must
necessarily be made in advance.</p>

<p>Upon the salad now set the collops, either in the form of a
crown or in that of a small turban; in the middle place a fine
lettuce heart, the leaves of which should be slightly opened out.</p>

 >1246—PALETS DE RIS DE VEAU</a> <span class="nw"><a href="#g_ecarlate">A L’ÉCARLATE</a></span></h3>

<p>Poach the sweetbreads; when they are cold, cut them into
collops half-an-inch thick, and trim them with a round, even
cutter. Stamp out some roundels of salted tongue with the
same cutter, but let them be only one-eighth inch thick, and
twice as many as the collops of veal sweetbread.</p>

<p>Coat the latter, on either side, with butter prepared with
mustard; and cover with a roundel of tongue.</p>

<p>Set the prepared collops on a tray; let the butter harden,
coat with jelly, and deck the middle of each quoit with a fine
slice of truffle.</p>

<p>Arrange the quoits in a circle on a round dish; put some
chopped jelly in the centre, and border the dish with very
regularly-cut jelly dice.</p>

<p>Serve a horse-radish sauce and an Italian salad separately.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Calf’s Liver">Calf’s Liver.</h3>

<p>Calf’s liver is served chiefly as a breakfast or luncheon
entrée.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in ordinary menus, it is sometimes served as
a relevé, braised and whole.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1247—Foie de Veau Braisé à la Bourgeoise"><a id="rcp.1247"
 >1247—FOIE DE VEAU BRAISÉ <span class="nw">A LA BOURGEOISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Lard the piece with large, seasoned strips of bacon, as for
“Bœuf à la Mode.” Brown it slightly in the oven, and then
put it into a saucepan garnished for braising. (No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>.)</p>

<p>Moisten with one pint of white wine, and reduce it completely.
This done, moisten again with brown stock, adding
one pint of Espagnole sauce per quart of the moistening.</p>

<p>It is sufficient if the moistening and the sauce reach a little
above the middle of the piece of liver.</p>

<p>When the cooking is two-thirds completed, transfer the liver
to another saucepan; surround it with carrots, shaped like elongated
olives and half-cooked in consommé; and some small
onions, half-cooked in butter.</p>

<p>The amount of this garnish of carrots and onions should
naturally be in proportion to the size of the piece of liver.</p>

<p>Strain the sauce over the whole, and complete the cooking
gently in the oven. Dish the liver with the carrots and onions
all round; reduce the sauce if necessary, and pour it over the
garnish.</p>

<p>N.B. The latter need not be arranged symmetrically.</p>

<p>On the contrary simplicity should be made a feature of these
bourgeois dishes.</p>

<p>Cut the calf’s liver into fairly thin slices, from two-and-a-half oz. to three oz. in weight. Season them with salt and pepper;
dredge them, and toss them in butter. Grill an equal number
of rashers of bacon.</p>

<p>Dish the slices of liver and the rashers of bacon alternately,

<p>Select a pale piece of calf’s liver and cut it into square pieces
two-thirds of an inch thick. Season with salt and pepper, and
toss the pieces in butter, just to stiffen them.</p>

<p>Put them into a basin with an equal quantity of <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>
salted breast of pork, cut into squares, and of slices of cooked
mushrooms. Add a few tablespoonfuls of stiff Duxelles sauce,
and toss the whole together, that each particle of the various ingredients
may become coated with Duxelles.</p>

<p>This done, impale the squares of liver and pork and the
slices of mushrooms upon a ringed skewer, alternating them
in so doing; sprinkle copiously with fine raspings and melted
butter, and set to grill gently.</p>

<p>These brochettes are served, either on a maître-d’hôtel butter,
or on a Duxelles, Fines Herbes, an Italian or other sauce.</p>

<p>Cut the calf’s liver into slices weighing three and a half oz.;
season these with salt and pepper; dredge them; sprinkle them
with oil, and grill them gently.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <span class="nw">prepare:—</span>(1) As many grilled half-tomatoes as
there are pieces of liver; (2) onions cut into thin roundels, seasoned,
dredged, and fried in oil; (3) a proportionate quantity

 </span></span></a>one-third oz. of salt, a pinch of pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add,
little by little, five oz. of very cold frangipan<!-- TN: original reads "frangipane" --> panada, and two
eggs.</p>

<p>Rub through a sieve; put the forcemeat in a bowl; work
it over ice, and finish it with two tablespoonfuls of chopped
onions, cooked in butter, without colouration; the yolks of two
eggs, and quarter pint of thick cream, added by degrees.</p>

<p>Pour this forcemeat into a well-buttered quart Charlotte-mould;
knock the latter gently on a folded serviette, with the
view of settling its contents, and put it to poach in the oven
in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, for about forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>When taking the loaf out of the oven, let it stand for five
minutes, that the forcemeat inside may thoroughly settle;
turn it out on a round dish, and cover it with a Duxelles,
Italienne, Bordelaise, brown caper, or other sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1253—Côtes de Veau"><a id="rcp.1253"
 >1253—CÔTES DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Veal cutlets may either be grilled or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, but the second
method of cooking them is, in most cases, preferable.</p>

<p>When they are <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, the cutlets should be cooked in clarified
butter, over a somewhat fierce fire and in a utensil large
enough to hold them without crowding.</p>

<p>This done, dish them; pour away the butter in which they
have been cooked; swill the saucepan, <i>i.e.</i>, dissolve the concentrated
gravy adhering to the sides and bottom of it with a liquid
in keeping with the garnish; either mushroom cooking-liquor,
white or red wine, or Madeira, etc.; and add this swilling-liquor,
reduced, to the accompanying sauce. The latter is
generally a buttered half-glaze, but the best adjunct to veal
cutlets is a pale meat glaze, moderately buttered.</p>

<p>All vegetable and paste garnishes, given under Cushion of
Veal, suit veal cutlets. I must therefore beg the reader to
refer to those recipes, as circumstances may dictate; and restrict
myself to a few formulæ which, in my opinion, are suited more
particularly to veal cutlets.</p>

 >1269—ROGNON DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA MONTPENSIER</span></a></h3>

<p>Trim the veal kidney, leaving a slight coating of fat all round
it, and cut into five or six slices. Season the latter, toss them
in butter over a brisk fire, and transfer them to a plate.</p>

<p>Swill the saucepan with one tablespoonful of Madeira, and
add thereto three tablespoonfuls of melted meat glaze, a few
drops of lemon juice, one and one-half oz. of butter, and a pinch
of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Dish the pieces of kidney, or set them in a timbale;
sprinkle them with the sauce, and in their midst set a heap
of asparagus-heads, cohered with butter, and one and one-half oz. of truffle slices.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1270—Rognon de Veau Portugaise"><a id="rcp.1270"
 >1270—ROGNON DE VEAU PORTUGAISE</a></h3>

<p>Cut up the veal kidney, and toss it in butter, after the manner
described under No. <a href="#rcp.1269">1269</a>.</p>

<p>Dish the pieces in a circle on a dish; set a very small, stuffed
half-tomato upon each, and garnish the centre of the dish with
a very reduced tomato <i><a href="#g_fondue">fondue</a></i>. Surround the kidney with a
sauce prepared as directed above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1271—Rognon de Veau à la Robert"><a id="rcp.1271"
 >1271—ROGNON DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA ROBERT</span></a></h3>

<p>Heat one oz. of butter in a small <i>cocotte</i>; put the seasoned
veal kidney therein; fry it over a brisk fire, and set it to cook
in the oven for about fifteen minutes. Serve the kidney as it
leaves the oven, and complete the procedure, at the table, in
the following <span class="nw">manner:—</span></p>

<p>Transfer the kidney to a hot plate. Place the <i>cocotte</i> on a
spirit lamp; pour into the former one glassful of excellent
liqueur brandy, and reduce to half. Meanwhile, quickly cut
the kidney into extremely thin slices, and cover these with an
overturned plate.</p>

<p>Add to the reduced liqueur brandy one coffeespoonful of
mustard, one oz. of butter cut into small pieces, the juice of a
quarter of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley; and work
the whole well with a fork, with the view of effecting the leason.</p>

<p>Put the sliced kidney into this sauce, together with the
<a id="png.442" href="#png.442"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>424<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gravy that has drained from it; heat the whole well, without
boiling, and serve on very hot plates.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1272—Tendrons de Veau"><a id="rcp.1272"
 >1272—TENDRONS DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>The tendrons are cut from breast of veal. They are, in fact,
the extreme ends of the ribs, including the cartilage of the
sternum.</p>

<p>If the tendrons are braised, treat them after the manner
described under “The Braising of White Meats” (No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>); or,
simply stew them in butter; moisten them with excellent veal
stock, and baste them frequently while cooking them. They
may also be treated like an ordinary veal <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sauté</a></i>, from which they
only differ in shape, and the various preparations of which may
be adapted to them.</p>

<p>The garnishes best suited to them are those of early-season
vegetables, and, as a matter of fact, the latter, together with
such pastes as noodles, macaroni, spaghetti, etc., are the garnishes
most often served with them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1273—Blanquette de Veau à l’Ancienne"><a id="rcp.1273"
 >1273—BLANQUETTE DE VEAU <span class="nw">A L’ANCIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut the veal tendrons into pieces weighing about three oz.
Then, slightly <a href="#g_blanch">blanch</a> them; cool them, and put them into a
saucepan with enough white stock to cover; add a very little
salt; set to boil, and skim.</p>

<p>For two lbs. of tendrons, add one small carrot; one fair-sized
onion, stuck with a clove; a faggot, consisting of one
leek, parsley stalks, and a fragment of thyme and bay; and set
to cook gently for one and one-half hours.</p>

<p>Prepare a white roux from one and one-half oz. of butter
and one and one-half oz. of flour; moisten with one pint of
veal cooking-liquor; add one oz. of mushroom parings, and
cook for a quarter of an hour, despumating the sauce the while.</p>

<p>Transfer the pieces of tendron, one by one, to a sautépan with
twelve small onions cooked in consommé, and fifteen small,
cooked and very white mushrooms. Finish the sauce with a
leason of two egg-yolks, mixed with three tablespoonfuls of
cream and a few drops of lemon juice; strain it over the veal
and its garnish; heat without boiling; dish in a timbale, and
sprinkle with a pinch of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>N.B. This blanquette may also be prepared with noodles
or <i><a href="#g_cepes">cèpes</a></i>, instead of with ordinary mushrooms.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1274—Blanquette de Veau aux Céleris, Cardons, etc."><a id="rcp.1274"
 >1274—BLANQUETTE DE VEAU AUX CÉLERIS, <span class="nw">CARDONS, ETC.</span></a></h3>

<p>Prepare the blanquette exactly as explained above, and set it
to cook with the veal and the vegetable selected for the garnish,
<a id="png.443" href="#png.443"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>425<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i>i.e.</i>, either small heads of celery cut into two or four, or cardoons,
cut into pieces and well <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>. The endives are not
<i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>; they need only be well washed and put with the veal.</p>

<p>When cooked, drain the vegetables, trim them, and dish
them in a timbale with the veal and the sauce; the latter prepared
as directed and strained over the meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1275—Blanquette de Veau aux Nouilles"><a id="rcp.1275"
 >1275—BLANQUETTE DE VEAU AUX NOUILLES</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as for “Blanquette à l’ancienne,” but suppress the
garnish of onions and mushrooms.</p>

<p>When the blanquette is dished, set thereon heaps of noodles,
parboiled and cohered with butter, and cover these with raw
noodles tossed quickly in butter; allow three oz. of tossed
noodles per lb. of those cohered.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1276—Fricassée de Veau"><a id="rcp.1276"
 >1276—FRICASSÉE DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Fricassée differs from blanquette in this, namely, that the
pieces of veal in the former are stiffened in butter without colouration.</p>

<p>When the meat has been well stiffened, besprinkle it with
about one oz. of flour per lb.; cook this flour with the meat for
a few minutes; then moisten the fricassée with white stock;
season, and set to boil, stirring the while. All the garnishes
of mushrooms and vegetables given for blanquette may be
served with fricassée; but in the case of the latter, both the meat
and the garnish are cooked in the sauce, the leason of which
is effected by means of egg-yolks and cream, as for blanquette.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1277—Fricadelles"><a id="rcp.1277"
 >1277—FRICADELLES</a></h3>

<p>Fricadelles are a kind of meat balls, somewhat like those
commonly prepared in private households. They are made
from raw or cooked meat, in the following <span class="nw">manner:—</span></p>

<p><i>Fricadelles with Raw Meat.</i>—For ten fricadelles, each
weighing three and one-half oz., chop up one lb. of very lean
veal, cleared of all fat and gristle, together with two-thirds of a lb. of butter. Put the whole into a bowl, and add thereto
five oz. of soaked and well-pressed crumb of bread, two eggs,
half an oz. of salt, a pinch of pepper and a little nutmeg, and
two oz. of chopped onion cooked in butter without colouration.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well, and divide it up into portions weighing
three and one-half oz.</p>

<p>Fashion these portions to the shape of quoits, by first rolling
them into balls on a flour-dusted board, and afterwards flattening
them out with the flat of a knife.</p>

<p>Heat some butter or very pure fat in a sautépan; put the
<a id="png.444" href="#png.444"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>426<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fricadelles therein; brown them on both sides, and then complete
their cooking in the oven.</p>

<p>This done, set them on a round dish, and serve them, either
with a vegetable purée, a Piquante or a Robert sauce.</p>

<p><i>Fricadelles with Cooked Meat.</i>—For ten fricadelles, each
weighing two and one-half oz., chop one lb. of cooked veal,
fat and lean, somewhat finely.</p>

<p>Put it into a bowl with a large pinch of salt, another of
pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the pulp of three fair-sized
potatoes, baked in the oven; three oz. of chopped onions, cooked
in butter without colouration; one large egg, and one tablespoonful
of chopped parsley. Mix well; divide up into portions
of the weight already given, and shape and cook them as in
the previous case.</p>

<p>These fricadelles are served with vegetable purées and the
sauces suited to those prepared from raw meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1278—Paupiettes de Veau"><a id="rcp.1278"
 >1278—PAUPIETTES DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p><a href="#g_paupiette">Paupiettes</a> or scrolls are made from extremely thin slices of
veal, four in. long by two in. wide. After having seasoned them,
cover them with forcemeat or very fine mincemeat; roll them,
with their forcemeat-coat inside, into scrolls, and tie them
round, once or twice, with string, that they may keep their
shape while cooking. They are sometimes covered with thin
rashers of bacon. <a href="#g_paupiette">Paupiettes</a> are always braised, gently and
protractedly.</p>

<p>They are generally garnished with vegetable purées; but
they may be served just as well with all vegetable garnishes.</p>

<p>By making them half the usual size, they may, after having
been braised, serve as the garnish for a timbale, together with
noodles, gniokis, spaghetti, or with Financière, Milanaise or
Napolitaine garnish, etc.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1279—Sautés de Veau"><a id="rcp.1279"
 >1279—SAUTÉS DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>The pieces best suited to veal <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sautés</a></i> are: the breast and the
shoulder, as also those parts of the haunch other than the
cushion and undercushion.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1280—Sauté de Veau à la Marengo"><a id="rcp.1280"
 >1280—SAUTÉ DE VEAU <span class="nw">A LA MARENGO</span></a></h3>

<p>Heat one pint of oil in a sautépan, until it smokes. Put
therein two lbs. of veal, cut into pieces, each weighing two oz.,
and fry until the latter are well set. Add a chopped half onion
and a crushed half-clove of garlic, and fry again for a few
moments.</p>

<p>Drain away the oil, tilting the sautépan with its lid on, for
<a id="png.445" href="#png.445"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>427<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the purpose; moisten with a quarter of a pint of white wine;
reduce, and add two-thirds of a quart of thin Espagnole sauce,
one and one-half lbs. of tomatoes, pressed and cut into pieces
(or one pint of tomato sauce), and a faggot.</p>

<p>Set to boil, and cook in the oven gently for one and one-half
hours.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, transfer the pieces of veal, one by
one, to another saucepan with fifteen small glazed onions, and
five oz. of mushrooms. Reduce the sauce; strain it over the
veal and its garnish, add two large pinches of <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> parsley,
and cook for a further quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>When about to serve, clear of all grease, dish in a timbale,
and surround with small heart-shaped <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumb,
fried in oil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1281—Sauté de Veau Chasseur"><a id="rcp.1281"
 >1281—SAUTÉ DE VEAU CHASSEUR</a></h3>

<p>Cut the veal into pieces as above, and fry these well in
butter or oil.</p>

<p>Drain away the grease; moisten with one quart of brown
stock, add two tablespoonfuls of tomato purée, and a faggot;
set to boil, and cook in the oven gently for one and one-half
hours.</p>

<p>Transfer the pieces to another saucepan; strain; reduce their
cooking-liquor by a quarter, and add it to one-quarter of a pint
of Chasseur sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.33">33</a>).</p>

<p>Pour this sauce over the pieces of veal, and cook again
for a quarter of an hour. Dish in a timbale, and sprinkle with
chopped parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1282—Sauté de Veau Printanier"><a id="rcp.1282"
 >1282—SAUTÉ DE VEAU PRINTANIER</a></h3>

<p>Fry the pieces of veal in butter. Moisten with two-thirds of
a quart of brown stock and one-fifth of a pint of half-glaze; add
a faggot; boil, and cook in the oven gently for one hour.</p>

<p>This done, transfer the pieces to another saucepan; add
thereto a garnish of carrots, new turnips, and small, new potatoes;
strain the sauce over the veal and the garnish, and cook
for a further three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Dish in a timbale and distribute over the <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sauté</a></i> a few tablespoonfuls
of peas and French beans in lozenge-form, both
cooked <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>.</p>

of raw, quartered mushrooms; ten chestnuts, three-parts cooked
in consommé, and eight <a href="#g_chipolata">Chipolata</a> sausages.</p>

<p>Reduce the sauce to one-third of a pint; strain it over the

<p>Veal <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sauté</a></i> may also be prepared with mushrooms, <i>fines

<h3 class="recipe" title="1285—Pain de Veau"><a id="rcp.1285"
 >1285—PAIN DE VEAU</a></h3>

<p>Prepare “Pain de Veau” exactly as directed under No. <a href="#rcp.1252">1252</a>; but substitute for the liver some very white veal.</p>

<p>Pain de veau is generally accompanied by a white sauce,
such as velouté prepared with mushroom essence, Allemande
sauce prepared with mushrooms, Suprême sauce, etc.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1286—Calf’s Feet"><a id="rcp.1286"
 >1286—CALF’S FEET</a></h3>

<p>Calf’s feet serve chiefly in supplying the gelatinous element
of aspics, and the body of braising stock. They are rarely
used in the preparation of a special dish; but, should they be
so used, they may be cooked and served after the manner
directed in the recipes treating of calf’s head.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1287—Calves’ Tongues"><a id="rcp.1287"
 >1287—CALVES’ TONGUES</a></h3>

<p>Provided the difference of size be allowed for, calf’s tongue
may be prepared like ox tongue, and served with the same
garnishes. (See Ox Tongue, Nos. <a href="#rcp.1153">1153</a> to <a href="#rcp.1158">1158</a> inclusive.)</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1288—Calf’s Brains and Amourettes" id="g_amourettes"><a id="rcp.1288"
 >1288—CALF’S BRAINS AND AMOURETTES</a></h3>

<p>Calf’s brains form the most wholesome and reparative diet
for all those who are debilitated by excessive head-work; and
the same remark applies to the brains of the ox and the sheep.</p>

<p>The amourettes mentioned here, which almost always
accompany ox brains, are only the spinal marrow of the ox or
the calf. This may be used in the preparation of a few special
dishes; but all the recipes dealing with brains may be applied
to it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1289—The Cooking of Brains"><a id="rcp.1289"
 >1289—THE COOKING OF BRAINS</a></h3>

<p>Carefully remove the membrane enveloping the brains or the
<a href="#g_amourettes">amourettes</a>, and put them to soak in fresh water, until they are
quite white. Put the brains in a saucepan with enough boiling
<a id="png.447" href="#png.447"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>429<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i>court-bouillon</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.163">163</a>) to cover them well; skim and then set
to cook gently.</p>

<p>Brains have this peculiarity, namely, that prolonged
cooking only stiffens them; thus, calf’s brains only take half
an hour to cook; but they may cook for two hours more without
harm, seeing that the process only tends to make them firmer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1290—Cervelle à la Beaumont"><a id="rcp.1290"
 >1290—CERVELLE <span class="nw">A LA BEAUMONT</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut the brains into slices; on each slice put a layer of <i>gratin</i>
force-meat (No. <a href="#rcp.202">202</a>) prepared from foie gras and softened by
means of a little cold, brown sauce, and a slice of truffle. Reconstruct
the brains by putting the coated slices together again.</p>

<p>Roll some puff-paste remains into a <i><a href="#g_galette">galette</a></i> one-fifth of an
inch thick, the diameter of which should be in proportion to
the size of the brains under treatment. Put the brains in the
middle of the <i><a href="#g_galette">galette</a></i>, and cover them with the same forcemeat
as that laid on the slices; sprinkle with chopped truffles; moisten
the edges of the paste, and draw these over the brains so as to
enclose the latter completely.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i>; make a slit in the top for the escape of steam, and
bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes. After taking the
pie out of the oven, pour a few tablespoonfuls of Périgueux
sauce into the former, and dish on a napkin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1291—Cervelle au Beurre Noir"><a id="rcp.1291"
 >1291—CERVELLE AU BEURRE NOIR</a></h3>

<p>Slice the brains; set the slices on a dish, and season them
with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Cook two oz. of butter in the frying-pan until it is slightly
blackened; throw therein a pinch of parsley <a href="#g_pluches"><i>pluches</i></a>, and
sprinkle the brains with this butter. Pour a few drops of
vinegar into the burning frying-pan, and add it to the brains.</p>

 >1292—CERVELLE AU BEURRE NOISETTE</a></h3>

<p>Slice and season the brains as above. Cook the butter until
it has acquired a golden colour and exhales a nutty smell; pour
it over the brains, and finish with a few drops of lemon juice
and a pinch of chopped parsley.</p>

 >1293—CERVELLE <span class="nw">A LA MARÉCHALE</span><!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Cut the brains into regular slices, one-third of an inch thick;
treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> with very fine bread-crumbs, and brown
them in clarified butter.</p>

<p>Dish them in the form of a circle, with a slice of truffle on

<div class="ns"> </div>

<h3 class="subhead" title="Relevés and Entrées">Relevés and Entrées.</h3>

<p>From the culinary standpoint, the ovine species supplies
three kinds of meat, <span class="nw">viz:—</span></p>

<p><i>Mutton</i>—properly so-called when the meat is derived from
the adult animal.</p>

<p><i>Lamb</i>—the young, weaned sheep, not yet fully grown, the
meat of which is the more highly esteemed the younger the
animal is.</p>

<p><i>House Lamb</i>—the sheep’s unweaned young that has not yet
grazed.</p>

<p>The “Pauillac” lamb, which is imported from France, is
the most excellent example of the last kind. Good house lambs
are also killed in England; they are quite equal to Pauillac
lamb, but their season is short. As regards ordinary English
mutton and lamb, however, the delicacy and quality of these
meats are unrivalled.</p>

<p>But for its greater delicacy and tenderness, grass lamb,
which corresponds with what the French call “agneau de pré-salé”
is scarcely distinguishable from mutton. The recipes
suited to it are the same as those given for mutton; and all that
is necessary is to allow for differences of quality in calculating
the time of cooking.</p>

<p>House lamb, the white flesh of which is quite different,
admits of some of the mutton recipes; but it is generally prepared
after special formulæ, the details of which I shall give
hereafter.</p>

<p>When served roasted, hot or cold, mutton and grass and
house lamb are always accompanied by mint sauce, the recipe
for which I gave under No. <a href="#rcp.136">136</a>.</p>

<p>In view of the similarity of their preparations, and in order
to avoid finicking repetitions, I have refrained from giving separate
recipes for lamb and mutton respectively. The reader will
therefore bear in mind that the formulæ relating to mutton also
apply to grass lamb.</p>

 >1302—NECK OF MUTTON       (Relevés)</a></h3>


<p><i>Saddle of mutton</i> is that part of the sheep which reaches from
the bone of the haunch to the floating ribs.</p>

<p><i>Baron of mutton</i> comprises the saddle and the two legs, <i>i.e.</i>,
a pair of hind-quarters.</p>

<p><i>Double</i> consists of the two unseparated legs, minus the
saddle.</p>

<p>The Baron and the Double are almost always cuts of lamb.</p>

<p>The fillet is one half of the saddle, when the latter is cut
into two, lengthwise; that is to say, divided down the middle in
suchwise as to bisect the spinal column. These fillets are sometimes
boned, rolled over with the kernel of meat in the centre,
and strung, in which case the skin should be removed before
rolling. Saddle of mutton, before being roasted, should be
cleared of all its superfluous underlying fat; and the flanks
should be so shortened as to just meet when drawn over the
fillets. The overlying skin should be removed, and the saddle
should be strung in five or six places to keep it in shape.</p>

<p>In the case of a saddle of lamb, the skin need not be completely
removed, but slit in various places. As to neck of
mutton, this should be shortened as for the cutting of ordinary
cutlets; the skin and the bones of the chine should be removed,
as also the meat at the end of the rib-bones, down to two-thirds in. from the extremity of each. The cushion is then covered
with slices of bacon, tied on with string.</p>

<p>When the piece is roasted and dished, a frill should be
placed on the end of each bared bone. Neck of mutton ought
never to comprise more than nine to ten ribs, counting from the
floating ones; it should consist of rather less if anything.</p>

<p>Mutton Relevés allow more particularly of vegetable and rice
garnishes.</p>

<p>Garnishes with sauces do not suit them so well, even when
the pieces are braised. As for paste garnishes, such as
macaroni, noodles, gniokis; they are seldom used.</p>

<p>Garnishes for mutton relevés should therefore be chosen, in
preference, from among the following, the details of which I
gave under “Filet de Bœuf” (Nos. <a href="#rcp.1044">1044</a> to <a href="#rcp.1074">1074</a>) and which I
recall <span class="nw">hereafter:—</span></p>

<p><i>Andalouse</i>, <i>Bouquetière</i>, <i>Châtelaine</i>, <i>Clamart</i>, <i>Dauphine</i>,
<a id="png.451" href="#png.451"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>433<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i>Dubarry</i>, <i>Duchesse</i>, <i>Japonaise</i>, <i>Jardinière</i>, <i>Lorette</i>, <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i>,
<i>Montmorency</i>, <i>Moderne</i>, <i>Nivernaise</i>, <i>Orientale</i>, <i>Petit-Duc</i>,
<i>Provençale</i>, <i>Renaissance</i>, <i>Richelieu</i>, <i>St. Germain</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from these compound garnishes, the following simple
garnishes also suit admirably, either alone, or separated by some
kind of potato <span class="nw">preparation:—</span></p>

<p><i>Braised Lettuce</i>, stuffed with ordinary forcemeat or rice.</p>

<p><i>Cabbages</i>, moulded to the shape of small balls, braised and
stuffed with fine mince-meat or rice.</p>

<p><i>Haricot-beans</i>, <i>Peas</i> and <i>Broad-beans</i>, cohered with butter.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus-heads</i>, white or green, cooked and cohered with
butter.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>, <i>Endives</i>, and <i>Chicory</i>, all braised. <i>Brussels
Sprouts</i>, <i>Cauliflowers</i>, <i>Broccoli<!-- TN: original reads "Brocoli" --></i>, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, the garnishes and modes of preparation termed:
<i>à l’Anglaise</i>, <i>à la Boulangère</i>, <i>Braisés</i>, <i>Mariné en Chevreuil<!-- TN: original reads "Chevreuit" --></i>,
which I give below for the leg and the shoulder, may be applied
perfectly well to other large pieces of mutton.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1303—Large Cold Joints of Mutton"><a id="rcp.1303"
 >1303—LARGE COLD JOINTS OF MUTTON</a></h3>

<p>Refer to Cold Beef; in all cases keep the dishing simple.</p>

<p>The garnishing is optional.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1304—Leg and Shoulder of Mutton"><a id="rcp.1304"
 >1304—LEG AND SHOULDER OF MUTTON</a></h3>

<p>Legs of mutton or lamb ought never to appear on any but
an ordinary luncheon menu. Although, strictly speaking, they
should always be served after one of the ways described hereafter,
all the garnishes given above may be applied to them.</p>

<p>Shoulders may be roasted whole; but they may also be
boned, seasoned inside, rolled up, and firmly strung. They
may be treated like the legs, and the same garnishes are suited
to them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1305—Gigot Bouilli à l’Anglaise"><a id="rcp.1305"
 >1305—GIGOT BOUILLI <span class="nw">A L’ANGLAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Trim the leg, shorten it in the region of the tibia bone, and
plunge it into a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the proportion
of one-third oz. of salt per quart of water.</p>

<p>For an ordinary leg, add: three medium-sized carrots, two
onions, each stuck with a clove, a faggot, and two cloves of
garlic.</p>

<p>Let the leg cook for a quarter of an hour for each two lbs. of
its weight.</p>

<p>Dish with vegetables all round, and serve at the same time
a butter sauce with capers.</p>

<p>N.B.—Leg of mutton <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> may be accompanied by
<a id="png.452" href="#png.452"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>434<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>purées of turnips, celery, etc., and these vegetables should cook
with the meat. A purée of potatoes or of haricot beans may be
sent to the table with the meat; but, in this case, of course, the
vegetables would be served separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1306—Braised Leg of Mutton"><a id="rcp.1306"
 >1306—BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON</a></h3>

<p>Suppress the pelvic bone, shorten the end bone and brown
the leg in the oven.</p>

<p>Now, put it in an oval utensil, garnished for braising; add
just enough white stock to barely cover the joint, and cook
gently, allowing forty minutes per lb. of meat.</p>

<p>Transfer the leg to a tray; strain the braising-liquor; clear
it of all grease, and reduce it to half. Sprinkle the meat with
a few tablespoonfuls of this reduced gravy, and set it to glaze
in the oven.</p>

<p>Serve at the same <span class="nw">time:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Either a purée of potatoes, of turnips, of haricot-beans, of
cauliflower, etc., or</p>

<p>(2) The reduced braising-liquor.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1307—Gigot à la Boulangère"><a id="rcp.1307"
 >1307—GIGOT <span class="nw">A LA BOULANGÈRE</span><!-- TN: grave invisible --></a></h3>

<p>The leg may either be boned, seasoned inside and strung; or
the end-bone may simply be shortened and that of the pelvis
removed.</p>

<p>In either case, put it in an earthenware dish, and brown it
well in the oven, on both sides; then complete its cooking, all
but a third.</p>

<p>This done, set round the joint four large, sliced onions, just
tossed in butter, that they may acquire some colour, and eight
large, peeled potatoes cut into roundels one half in. thick.
Sprinkle this garnish with the grease of the joint, and then complete
the cooking of the leg and its garnish.</p>

<p>Serve in the dish in which the joint has cooked.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1308—Gigot Marine en Chevreuil"><a id="rcp.1308"
 >1308—GIGOT MARINE EN CHEVREUIL</a></h3>

<p>Shorten the end-bone; remove the bone of the pelvis, and
skin the top of the leg, leaving the meat in that region quite
bare. Lard with very small strips of bacon, and put the meat
into a <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> prepared after the manner described under No. <a href="#rcp.170">170</a>. The length of its stay in the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> should be based
upon the tenderness of the meat and atmospheric conditions.
In winter the time averages about three or four days, and in
summer two days.</p>

<p><i>To Roast the Joint.</i>—Withdraw it from the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> and
dry it thoroughly; set it on a stand in the baking-tray; and put
<a id="png.453" href="#png.453"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>435<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it into a very fierce oven, that the meat may <i>set</i> immediately.
The object of the very fierce oven is to prevent the juices
absorbed from the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> escaping in steam and thereby
hardening the meat.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the operation, <a href="#g_rissole">rissole</a> the larding bacon
well.</p>

<p>Set on a long dish; fix a frill to the bone, and serve a Chevreuil
sauce separately.</p>

<p><i>Chevreuil Sauce à la Française.</i>—With the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> of the
joint and a <i><a href="#g_mirepoix">Mirepoix</a></i> with ham, prepare a sufficient quantity of
Poivrade sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.49">49</a>) to obtain two-thirds of a pint of it after
it has been strained through a colander—an operation which
should be effected with the application of great pressure to the
aromatics.</p>

<p>Despumate this sauce for thirty minutes, and add, little by
little, half a wine-glassful of excellent red wine. Finish the seasoning
with a little cayenne and a pinch of powdered sugar,
and once more rub the whole through tammy or a fine strainer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1309—Gigot à la Soubise"><a id="rcp.1309"
 >1309—GIGOT <span class="nw">A LA SOUBISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Braise the leg of mutton as shown under No. <a href="#rcp.247">247</a>. When it
is two-thirds done, transfer it to another utensil; strain the
braising-liquor over it, and add thereto three lbs. of sliced onions
and two-third lb. of rice.</p>

<p>Gently complete the cooking of the joint, together with the
onions and the rice. This <span class="nw">done:—</span>(1) put it on a baking-tray
and glaze it in the oven; (2) quickly rub the onions and the rice
through a fine sieve or tammy.</p>

<p>Set the leg of mutton on a long dish; put a frill on the
bone, and serve, separately, the well-heated Soubise, finished
with one oz. of butter.</p>

<p>N.B.—This Soubise may be prepared separately; but in this
case it has much less flavour than when it is made from the
onions and the rice which have cooked in the braising-liquor.
I therefore urge the adoption of the recipe as it stands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1310—Cold Leg of Mutton"><a id="rcp.1310"
 >1310—COLD LEG OF MUTTON</a></h3>

<p>Dish it very simply, like other cold large joints of mutton.</p>


<p><h3 class="recipe" title="1311—Cutlets"><a id="rcp.1311"
 >1311—CUTLETS</a></h3>

<p>Mutton and lamb cutlets are sometimes <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>; but grilling
is the most suitable method of cooking them. When the nature
of their preparation requires that they should be treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à
l’anglaise</i></a>, fry them in clarified butter. All the garnishes, given
<a id="png.454" href="#png.454"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>436<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>under “Tournedos,” except those served with sauces, may be
applied to cutlets.</p>

<p>The latter also allow of a few special garnishes, and these I
give in the following recipes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1312—Côtelettes à la Champvallon (10 Cutlets)"><a id="rcp.1312"
 >1312—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA CHAMPVALLON</span> (10 Cutlets)</a></h3>

<p>Take some cutlets from the region underlying the shoulder;
that is to say, those uncovered by the removal of this joint.
And do not clear the bone-ends of their meat, as when frills are
to be fixed to them.</p>

<p>Season them with salt and pepper, and brown them in butter
on both sides. This done, put them in an earthenware dish with
half lb. of sliced onions, tossed in butter without colouration;
moisten with enough white stock to almost cover the cutlets and
the onions; add the quarter of a clove of garlic, crushed, and a
faggot; boil, and set in the oven. At the end of twenty
minutes, add one and one-half lbs. of potatoes, fashioned to
the shape of corks, and cut into thin roundels; season, and
complete the cooking, basting often the while.</p>

<p>When the cutlets are cooked, the moistening should be almost
entirely reduced.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1313—Côtelettes Laura"><a id="rcp.1313"
 >1313—CÔTELETTES LAURA</a></h3>

<p>Grill the cutlets, and, meanwhile, prepare a garnish (the
quantity of which should be such as to allow two and one-half oz. of it per cutlet) of parboiled macaroni, cut into half-inch
lengths, cohered with cream, and combined, per lb., with three
and one-half oz. of peeled, pressed, and <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> tomatoes,
tossed in butter.</p>

<p>Or, when white truffles are in season, prepare some macaroni
with cream, as above, combined with the peelings of raw, white
truffles.</p>

<p>Cut some very soft pig’s caul into triangles, proportionate in
size to the cutlets; spread a little macaroni on each triangle; on
the latter set a cutlet; cover the cutlets with some more macaroni,
and enclose the whole in the caul. Lay the cutlets on a dish.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with fine raspings and melted butter, and set to
grill at the salamander, or in a fierce oven, for seven or eight
minutes.</p>

<p>Dish the cutlets in the form of a crown, and surround them
with a thread of clear half-glaze sauce, combined with tomatoes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1314—Côtelettes à la Maintenon"><a id="rcp.1314"
 >1314—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA MAINTENON</span></a></h3>

<p>Fry the cutlets in butter, on one side only. This done, put
a heaped tablespoonful of a <i>Maintenon</i> preparation (No. <a href="#rcp.226">226</a>)
<a id="png.455" href="#png.455"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>437<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on each; shape it like a dome, by means of the blade of a small
knife dipped in tepid water, and put the cutlets, one by one,
on a tray. The <i>Maintenon</i> preparation should be laid on the
cooked side of each cutlet and sprinkled with fine raspings and
melted butter. Now put the cutlets in a rather hot oven for
seven or eight minutes in order <span class="nw">to:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Allow a <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> to form over the surface of the garnish.</p>

<p>(2) Finish the cooking of the cutlets.</p>

<p>Dish the latter in the form of a crown, and serve, separately,
a sauceboat of meat glaze finished with butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1315—Côtelettes à la Murillo"><a id="rcp.1315"
 >1315—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA MURILLO</span></a></h3>

<p>Fry the cutlets in butter, on one side only; and garnish the
cooked side, dome-fashion, with a fine hash of mushrooms,
cohered with a little very reduced Béchamel sauce.</p>

<p>Set them on a tray; sprinkle with grated Parmesan and a
few drops of melted butter, and glaze in a fierce oven. Dish
the cutlets in the form of a crown; fix a frill to each, and surround
them with mild capsicums and tomatoes, both of which
should be sliced, tossed in butter, and mixed.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1316—Côtelettes à la Provençale"><a id="rcp.1316"
 >1316—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA PROVENÇALE</span></a></h3>

<p>For ten <span class="nw">cutlets:—</span>(1) Reduce one-half pint of Béchamel sauce
to a third, and add thereto the third of a garlic clove, crushed,
and the yolks of three eggs; (2) prepare at the same time as
the cutlets, ten grilled mushrooms; and ten stoned, stuffed and
poached olives, girded by a strip of anchovy fillet.</p>

<p>Fry the cutlets in butter, on one side only. Cover the
cooked side of each with the preparation described above; set
them on a tray; sprinkle them with a few drops of melted butter,
and put them in the oven, that their garnish may be glazed
and that their cooking may be completed.</p>

<p>Dish in the form of a circle; place a grilled mushroom
(convex side uppermost) in the middle of each cutlet, and,
on each mushroom, a stuffed olive.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1316a—Côtelettes de Mouton à la Reforme"><a id="rcp.1316a"
 >1316a—CÔTELETTES DE MOUTON <span class="nw">A LA REFORME</span></a></h3>

<p>Trim six mutton cutlets; season them; dip them in melted
butter, and roll them in bread-crumbs, combined with finely-chopped
ham in the proportion of a third of the weight of the
bread-crumbs. Now cook them gently in clarified butter.</p>

<p>Dish them in a circle on a hot dish, and send the following
sauce to the table with <span class="nw">them:—</span></p>

<p>Take a small saucepan, and mix therein three tablespoonfuls
of half-glaze sauce, the same quantity of Poivrade sauce,
<a id="png.456" href="#png.456"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>438<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and one coffeespoonful of red-currant jelly; add one coffeespoonful
of each of the following short <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> garnishes to
the sauce; viz.: hard-boiled white of egg; very red, salted
tongue; gherkins; mushrooms, and truffles.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1317—Côtelettes à la Sévigné"><a id="rcp.1317"
 >1317—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA SÉVIGNÉ</span><!-- TN: second acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Have ready a preparation of mushroom and artichoke-bottom
croquettes, in the proportion of one heaped tablespoonful
for each cutlet.</p>

<p>Fry the cutlets in butter, on one side only. Garnish the
fried side of each, dome-fashion, with the above preparation;
treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and sprinkle them with melted butter.</p>

<p>Put them in the oven to complete their cooking, and, at
the same time, to colour their coating of egg and bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Dish in the form of a crown.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1318—Côtelettes à la Suédoise"><a id="rcp.1318"
 >1318—CÔTELETTES <span class="nw">A LA SUÉDOISE</span><!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Place the cutlets on a dish, and drop thereon some minced
onions and shallots, bits of parsley stalks, thyme and bay.
Sprinkle them with the juice of a lemon and a few drops of
oil, and leave them to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for thirty minutes, turning
them over the while, from time to time.</p>

<p>This done, dry them; dip them in melted butter, sprinkle
them with bread-crumbs, and grill them.</p>

<p>Dish them in the form of a crown, and garnish the centre
of the dish with the following, which may also be sent separately:
one-half lb. of peeled and finely-sliced apples, quickly
stewed to a purée with the third of a wineglassful of white
wine. When about to serve, add to this purée two and one-half oz. of finely-grated horse-radish, or the latter grated and
afterwards finely chopped.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1319—Côtelettes en Belle Vue"><a id="rcp.1319"
 >1319—CÔTELETTES EN BELLE VUE</a></h3>

<p>Proceed after one of the recipes given for veal cutlets and
grenadins “en Belle Vue.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1320—Côtelettes en Chaudfroid"><a id="rcp.1320"
 >1320—CÔTELETTES EN CHAUDFROID</a></h3>

<p>Cut some very regular cutlets from a neck of mutton or
lamb, which should have been trimmed as explained, braised,
and left to cook in its braising-liquor. Clear all grease from
the latter; strain it; reduce it, and add to it a brown chaud-froid
sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.34">34</a>).</p>

<p>Dip the cutlets in the sauce when it is almost cold; set
them on a tray; deck the kernel of meat in each with a fine slice
<a id="png.457" href="#png.457"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>439<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of truffle, and sprinkle with cold, melted aspic. When the
sauce has set well, pass the point of a small knife round the
cutlets, with the view of removing the superfluous sauce; and
either dish them round a vegetable salad, cohered and moulded,
or simply dish them in the form of a circle and place a pyramid
of cohered, vegetable salad in their midst.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1321—Noisettes de Mouton"><a id="rcp.1321"
 >1321—NOISETTES DE MOUTON</a></h3>

<p>Mutton <i>noisettes</i>, and especially those of lamb, may be
classed among the choicest of entrées. They are cut from either
the fillet or the neck; but, in the latter case, only the first six
or seven ribs are used.</p>

<p><i>Noisettes</i> are grilled or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, and all the recipes given for
Tournedos (Nos. <a href="#rcp.1077">1077</a> to <a href="#rcp.1139">1139</a>) and for cutlets, may be applied
to them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1322—Minion Fillets"><a id="rcp.1322"
 >1322—MINION FILLETS</a></h3>

<p>The minion fillets of mutton or lamb consist of the two
muscles which lie under the saddle. Their mode of preparation
changes according to their size. Thus, if they are small, they
are served whole, after having been trimmed, sometimes larded;
and <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>.</p>

<p>If they are large, they are divided into two or three parts,
cut laterally and aslant; they are flattened, trimmed to the shape
of ellipses, seasoned, dipped in melted butter, sprinkled with
fine bread-crumbs, and finally, gently grilled.</p>

<p>Minion fillets of beef, obtained from the narrow extremity
or head of the fillet, are also used occasionally; and these are
generally flattened, dipped in butter and fine bread-crumbs, and
grilled.</p>

<p>These fillets are served chiefly with vegetable purées or with
<i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoines</a></i> of fresh vegetables.</p>

<p>The sauces best suited to them are the Béarnaise and the
Robert Escoffier.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1323—Sheep’s Tongues"><a id="rcp.1323"
 >1323—SHEEP’S TONGUES</a></h3>

<p>Salted or fresh sheep’s tongues make an excellent luncheon
entrée.</p>

<p>They are cooked after the manner of ox and calf’s tongues,
due allowance being made for the difference of size.</p>

<p>The various garnishes given for ox and calf’s tongues may
also be used in this case.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1324—Sheep’s Trotters"><a id="rcp.1324"
 >1324—SHEEP’S TROTTERS</a></h3>

<p>Sheep’s trotters, as they reach us from the purveyor, should
first be well singed over spirits of wine, and then rubbed with
a clean piece of linen. The little tuft of hair in the cleft of
<a id="png.458" href="#png.458"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>440<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the hoof is next removed, the hoof itself is suppressed, and
the trotters are split open lengthwise and boned. Sheep’s
trotters are cooked like calf’s feet, in the special <i>court-bouillon</i>
or blanc, given under No. <a href="#rcp.167">167</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1325—Fritôt of Sheep’s Trotters"><a id="rcp.1325"
 >1325—FRITÔT<!-- TN: original lacks circumflex --> OF SHEEP’S TROTTERS</a></h3>

<p>Fifteen minutes before frying them, put the sheep’s trotters
into a receptacle with lemon juice, a few drops of oil and some
chopped parsley; keeping the quantity of these ingredients in
proportion to the number of trotters. Be careful to toss the
latter from time to time in the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.</p>

<p>A few moments before serving, dip the half-trotters into
batter (No. <a href="#rcp.232">232</a>) and plunge them into an abundant and hot
frying-medium.</p>

<p>Drain them when the batter is nicely dry and golden; and
dish on a napkin with a border of very green fried parsley.</p>

<p>Serve a tomato sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1326—Pieds de Mouton Poulette"><a id="rcp.1326"
 >1326—PIEDS DE MOUTON POULETTE</a></h3>

<p>For this dish the trotters should, as far as possible, be
freshly cooked. For twenty trotters prepare two-thirds of a pint
of poulette sauce; add the trotters thereto, well drained; toss
them in the sauce, and dish them in a timbale with a sprinkling
of chopped parsley.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1327—Pieds de Mouton Rouennaise"><a id="rcp.1327"
 >1327—PIEDS DE MOUTON ROUENNAISE</a></h3>

<p>Instead of cooking the sheep’s trotters in a <i>blanc</i>, braise
them; add a little Madeira to their braising-liquor, and cook
them thoroughly.</p>

<p>Prepare a forcemeat, consisting of one and one-half lbs. of
very fine sausage-meat; three oz. of chopped onions, cooked in
butter without colouration, and a large pinch of parsley.</p>

<p>When the trotters are cooked, transfer them to a dish;
almost entirely reduce their braising-liquor; add to this two
liqueur-glassfuls of burnt brandy, for each ten trotters, and add
this reduced braising-liquor to the forcemeat. Cut ten rectangles
six inches long by four inches wide out of pig’s caul.</p>

<p>Spread a tablespoonful of forcemeat over each; set two

<h3 class="recipe" title="1329—Mutton Kidneys"><a id="rcp.1329"
 >1329—MUTTON KIDNEYS</a></h3>

<p>Mutton kidneys are either grilled or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>. When they are
to be grilled, first remove the fine skin enveloping them, cut
them in halves, without completely severing them on their concave
side, and impale them on a small skewer, with the view
of keeping them open during the grilling operation. Before
grilling they may or may not be dipped in melted butter and
rolled in bread-crumb.</p>

<p>When they are to be <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>, clear the kidneys, as before,
of the thin skin which envelops them; cut them into halves,
and then into slices one-quarter in. thick.</p>

<p>Kidneys, of what kind soever, should be cooked very quickly,
otherwise they harden. After having seasoned them, put them
into very hot butter, and toss them over a fierce fire in order
to stiffen them. This done, drain them; and let them stand
for a few minutes, that they may exude the blood they contain,
which sometimes has a distinct ammoniacal smell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, swill the utensil in which they have been <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>,
and finish the sauce, to which they are added when dishing
up. Never let the kidneys boil in the sauce, for they would
immediately harden.</p>

<p>For six kidneys put one tablespoonful of finely-chopped
shallots into the saucepan, and just heat it. Moisten with one-sixth
of a pint of white wine; reduce to half; add two tablespoonfuls
of melted meat glaze, and a few drops of lemon-juice,
and put the kidneys in this sauce. Add two and one-half oz. of butter, cut into small pieces; melt this on the corner
of the stove, tossing and rolling the pan the while; dish in a

<p>Swill the saucepan with one-half pint of champagne per six
kidneys; reduce almost entirely; add two tablespoonfuls of
melted meat glaze; add a small quantity of butter, and pour
this sauce over the kidneys.</p>

<p>N.B.—The preparation of kidneys <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> with wine always
follows the same principle; that is to say, the saucepan in which
the kidneys have cooked is always swilled with a quantity of
wine, in proportion to the number of kidneys; a proportionate
amount of meat glaze is then added, and after the sauce has been
slightly buttered, the kidneys are tossed in it.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1344—Cassoulet"><a id="rcp.1344"
 >1344—CASSOULET</a></h3>

<p>(1) Set one quart of haricot beans to cook with two quarts
of water, one-third oz. of salt, one carrot, one onion stuck with
a clove, one faggot, six garlic cloves, and two-thirds lb. of fresh
pork rind, <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> and strung together. Boil; skim; cover,
and cook gently for one hour. At the end of this time, add
two-thirds lb. of breast of pork, and a sausage with garlic, of
the same weight as the pork. Salt the beans very moderately,
allowing for the reduction which they have ultimately to
undergo.</p>

<p>Complete the cooking of the whole gently.</p>

<p>(2) Fry gently in lard one lb. of shoulder, and the same
weight of breast, of mutton; both cut into pieces one and one-half oz. in weight.</p>

<p>This done, drain away half the grease; add two chopped
<a id="png.463" href="#png.463"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>445<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>onions and two crushed cloves of garlic, and fry again until
the onions have acquired a slight colour. Now pour in one-sixth
pint of good tomato purée; moisten the meat, enough to
cover, with the cooking-liquor of haricot beans, and cook gently
in the oven for one and one-half hours at least.</p>

<p>(3) Garnish the bottom and sides of some <i>cocottes</i> or deep
dishes with bacon rind; fill these with alternate layers of the
pieces of mutton, the beans, the bacon cut into dice, and the
sausage cut into roundels.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the surface with raspings, and set the <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> to

<p>Cut two lbs. of lean mutton into cubes of one and one-third in. side, and fry these in three oz. of lard, with one chopped
onion, salt, and a pinch of powdered curry. When the meat
is frizzled and the onions begin to colour, sprinkle with one
and one-third oz. of flour; cook the latter a while; moisten
with one and one-third pints of water or stock; boil, stirring
the while, so as to dissolve the roux, and then cook gently in
the oven for one and one-half hours. When about to serve, clear
of all grease and dish in a timbale.</p>

<p>Send a timbale of rice à l’Indienne<!-- TN: original reads "indienne" but every other instance is capitalised --> separately.</p>

<p>Bone a medium-sized leg of mutton, and cut the meat into
squares, three oz. in weight. Lard each square with a large,
seasoned strip of bacon, inserted with the grain of the meat.
Put the pieces into a <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i> with a sliced half-carrot and
onion, three cloves of garlic, a little thyme, bay, and parsley
stalks. Moisten with one and one-third pints of good, red wine
and four tablespoonfuls of oil, and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> in the cool for two
hours.</p>

<p><span class="nw">Prepare:—</span>(1) Three chopped onions mixed with two
crushed garlic cloves; (2) one-half lb. of lean bacon, cut into

<i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> and cut into squares of one in. side; (4) a large bunch
of parsley, containing a small piece of dry, orange peel. Garnish
the bottom and sides of a <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i> with thin slices of
bacon; set the pieces of mutton in layers inside, and alternate
them with layers of onion, bacon and bacon rind; sprinkle a
pinch of powdered thyme and bay on each layer of meat. Put
the faggot in the middle.</p>

<p><a id="png.464" href="#png.464"><span class="pagenum"><span

one-fifth pint of brown stock; cover with slices of bacon; close
the <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i>, and seal down the lid by means of a thread
of soft paste, in order that the steam may be concentrated inside.</p>

<p>Boil on the side of the stove; put the <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i> in an oven
of regular heat (a baker’s oven if possible) that the cooking
process may be gentle and steady, and cook for five hours.</p>

overlying slices of bacon; clear of grease; remove the faggot,
and dish the <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i> on a napkin.</p>

<p>N.B.—According to the household method, the “Daube”
is served in the <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i> itself; but, subject to the demands of
the service and in order that the preparation may keep its
bucolic character, it may be served in small earthenware
utensils.</p>

<p>Cold Daube constitutes an excellent luncheon dish. All
that is needed is to put what is left into a small <i><a href="#g_daubiere">daubière</a></i>, where,
as a result of the binding properties of the pork rinds, it will
set in a mass.</p>

<p>When about to serve, turn out on a round dish; surround

<p>An unalterable principle governs the preparation of émincés<!-- TN: first acute invisible -->
and hashes, which is that the meats constituting these dishes
should never boil if it be desired that they be not hard.</p>

<p>They should, therefore, only be heated in their accompanying
garnish or sauce, and in the case of émincés<!-- TN: first acute invisible -->, cut as
finely as possible.</p>

<p>For the various recipes under this head, see the Chapter on
Beef. (Nos. <a href="#rcp.1175">1175</a>, <a href="#rcp.1178">1178</a> and <a href="#rcp.1179">1179</a>.)</p>

<p>Heat three oz. of lard in a sautépan. Put therein one-half lb. of lean bacon, cut into dice and <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>, and twenty small
onions. When the bacon is frizzled and the onions have
acquired a good colour, drain both on a dish. In the same fat,
fry three lbs. of breast, neck and shoulder of mutton, all three
being cut into pieces weighing about three oz. Keep the meat
in the fat until each piece of it has acquired a frizzled coat.</p>

<p>Drain away half of the grease; add three crushed cloves of
garlic; dust with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and cook the latter,
stirring the while.</p>

<p>Moisten with one quart of water; season with one-third oz.
<a id="png.465" href="#png.465"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Cut two lbs. of boned breast and shoulder of mutton into
pieces, as above.</p>

<p>Slice two lbs. of potatoes and chop four medium-sized
onions.</p>

<p>Take a saucepan just large enough to hold these ingredients
and the moistening; line the bottom of the utensil with a layer
of the pieces of meat, and season the latter with salt and pepper.
Upon the meat spread a litter of sliced potatoes and chopped
onions; repeat the operation, again and again, until all the
ingredients are used up, and remember to place a faggot in the
middle.</p>

<p>Moisten with one and one-third pint of water, and cook
gently in the oven for one and one-half hours. The potatoes

<h3 class="recipe" title="1351—Moussaka"><a id="rcp.1351"

<p>(1) Cut six fine egg-plants into halves, lengthwise; <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> the
pulp somewhat deeply with the point of a small knife, and fry
them until their pulp may be easily removed. Do this with a
spoon, and put the pulp aside with the skins of the egg-plants.</p>

<p>(2) Peel two fair-sized egg-plants; cut them into roundels
one-third in. thick; season them, dredge them; fry them in
oil, and put them aside.</p>

<p>(3) Chop up the pulp withdrawn from the egg-plants, and
put it into a basin with one and one-half lbs. of very lean,
cooked mutton, chopped or cut into very small dice; two tablespoonfuls
of very finely-chopped onion, fried in butter; a pinch
of parsley; a piece of crushed garlic as large as a pea; three oz. of roughly-chopped raw mushrooms, fried in butter; two
eggs; two tablespoonfuls of cold Espagnole sauce; one tablespoonful
of tomato purée; a pinch of salt, and another of
pepper. Mix the whole well.</p>

<p>(4) Butter a low-bordered quart Charlotte mould; line it all
over with the egg-plant skins, and lay these black side
<a id="png.466" href="#png.466"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>448<span class="ns">]

one in. thick; on this layer place a few fried roundels of
egg-plant, and continue thus with alternate layers of mince and
egg-plant. Cover the last layer of mince-meat with the remains
of the egg-plant skins, and cook in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> for one hour.</p>

<p>When taking the mould out of the oven, let it stand for five
minutes in order that the ingredients may settle; turn out on
a round dish, and besprinkle the surface of the Moussaka with
chopped parsley.</p>

substitution of mutton for the beef.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1353—Navarin Printanier"><a id="rcp.1353"
 >1353—NAVARIN PRINTANIER</a></h3>

<p>Heat four oz. of clarified fat in a sautépan, and put into it
four lbs. of breast, neck and shoulder of mutton; all three cut
into pieces weighing two and one-half oz. Fry over a very
brisk fire; season with one-third oz. of salt, a pinch of ground
pepper, and another of sugar.</p>

<p>The sugar settles slowly on the bottom of the sautépan,
where it turns to caramel; it is then dissolved by the moistening,
and thus gives the sauce the required colour.</p>

<p>When the meat is well fried, remove almost all the fat;
sprinkle with one and one-half oz. of flour; cook the latter
for a few minutes, and moisten with one and one-half quarts of
water or stock.</p>

<p>Boil, stirring the while, and add two-thirds lb. of fresh
<i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> tomatoes or one-fifth pint of tomato purée; one
crushed clove of garlic, and a large faggot. Cover and cook
in the oven for one hour.</p>

<p>This done, transfer the pieces of mutton, one by one, to
another saucepan with twenty small, new onions; twenty
pieces of new trimmed carrots; twenty pieces of new turnips,
cut to the shape of long olives and tossed with butter in a
frying-pan; twenty small, new potatoes, cut into two, and
trimmed, or whole; one-sixth pint of fresh peas, and an equal
quantity of raw French beans, cut into lozenges. Strain the
sauce over the whole; set to boil, and continue cooking slowly
in the oven for one hour; taking care from time to time to baste
the overlying vegetables with sauce.</p>

<p>Dish in a timbale and serve very hot.</p>

<p>N.B.—When put into the sauce, the vegetables cook much
less quickly than in boiling water. In the Navarin, moreover,
<a id="png.467" href="#png.467"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>449<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they are cooked by means of gradual penetration; thus, by
slackening the cooking speed of the Navarin, they are cooked
to the required extent.</p>

 >1354—PILAW DE MOUTON <span class="nw">A LA TURQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>Mutton Pilaff is, in fact, nothing but a Navarin in which
the tomatoes dominate the other ingredients; it is flavoured with
ginger or saffron, according to circumstances, and the usual
vegetables are replaced by rice. Prepared in this way, it does
not lend itself very well to the exigencies of a restaurant service.</p>

<p>More often, therefore, it is treated like curried mutton; but,
instead of serving it with rice à l’Indienne, it is dished in the
midst of a pilaff-rice border. Sometimes, too, the rice is served
separately, after the manner of a curry dish.</p>

<p>Large joints of lamb for Relevés are cut like those of mutton.</p>

<p>One joint, however, should be added, which is “The
Haunch”; and this consists of one leg and half the loin
attached.</p>

<p>Large joints of house lamb should be <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i> or roasted.
Their most suitable adjunct is either their own stock, or a
thickened, highly seasoned and clear gravy.</p>

<p>House Lamb Relevés are chiefly garnished with early-season
or new vegetables; but all the garnishes given under Mutton
Relevés may also be served with them, provided the difference
in size be taken into account. In addition to these garnishes,
saddle of lamb admits of all the preparations given under saddle
of veal (Nos. <a href="#rcp.1181">1181</a> to <a href="#rcp.1191">1191</a>).</p>

 >1360—SELLE D’AGNEAU DE LAIT ÉDOUARD<!-- TN: acute invisible --> VII.</a></h3>

<p>Completely bone the saddle from underneath, in suchwise as
to leave the skin intact; season it inside, and place in the middle
a fine foie gras, studded with truffles and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> in Marsala.</p>

<p>Reconstruct the saddle, and wrap it tightly in a piece of
muslin; put it in a saucepan just large enough to hold it, on a
litter of pieces of bacon rind, cleared of all fat and <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>.
<a id="png.468" href="#png.468"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>450<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Moisten, enough to cover, with the braising-liquor of a cushion
of veal; add thereto the Marsala used in <i>marinading</i> the foie
gras, and poach for about forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Before withdrawing the saddle, make sure that the foie gras
is sufficiently cooked. Remove the muslin, and put the saddle
in an oval <i><a href="#g_terrine_2">terrine à pâté</a></i> just large enough to hold it. Strain
the cooking-liquor over it, without clearing the former of grease,
and set it to cool.</p>

<p>When the saddle is quite cold, carefully clear away the grease
that lies upon it, first by means of a spoon and then by means
of boiling water. Serve it very cold, in the terrine as it stands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1361—Carré d’Agneau Beaucaire"><a id="rcp.1361"
 >1361—CARRÉ<!-- TN: acute invisible --> D’AGNEAU BEAUCAIRE</a></h3>

<p>Having trimmed the neck of lamb, as explained, brown it
in butter; surround it with eight small, Provence half-artichokes,
and cook gently in the oven. The artichokes in question have
no chokes and are very tender.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, peel, press, <i><a href="#g_concass">concass</a></i> and season four or five tomatoes,
and fry them in butter. When they are ready, add a large
pinch of chopped tarragon to them.</p>

<p>Dish the tomatoes; set the neck upon them, and surround

<p>Fry a shortened and well-trimmed neck of lamb, in butter.</p>

<p>This done, transfer it to an oval <i>cocotte</i> with ten small onions
browned in butter, and two medium-sized potatoes, cut into large
dice, shaped like garlic cloves, and <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>. Sprinkle the
whole with melted butter and cook gently in the oven.</p>

<p>Serve the preparation as it stands, in the <i>cocotte</i>, placing the

 >1363—CARRÉ D’AGNEAU <span class="nw">A LA BOULANGÈRE</span></a></h3>

<p>Fry the neck of lamb with butter, in an earthenware dish,
and surround it with sliced onions, tossed in butter, and sliced
potatoes; both of which vegetables should be in quantities in
proportion to the size of the piece of meat. The “à la Boulangère”
procedure is always the same, and was explained under
No. <a href="#rcp.1307">1307</a>, but allowances should always be made for the particular
size and tenderness of the piece.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1365—Carré d’Agneau Mireille"><a id="rcp.1365"
 >1365—CARRÉ D’AGNEAU MIREILLE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some Anna potatoes (No. <a href="#rcp.2203">2203</a>) in an oval earthenware
dish, and add a third of the quantity of potatoes of raw,
minced artichoke-bottoms.</p>

<p>When the potatoes are three-parts cooked, stiffen the neck
in butter; place it on the potatoes, and complete the cooking of
the two, basting often the while with melted butter.</p>

<p>Send the preparation to the table on the dish that has
served in the cooking process.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1366—Carré d’Agneau Printanier"><a id="rcp.1366"
 >1366—CARRÉ D’AGNEAU PRINTANIER</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the following garnish: eight small onions, half-cooked
in butter; ten carrots of the size and shape of garlic
cloves, cooked in consommé and glazed; and ten turnips of
the same shape and size, similarly treated.</p>

<p>Put these vegetables into a <i>cocotte</i> with three tablespoonfuls
of fresh peas; the same quantity of raw, French beans, cut into
lozenge form; two or three tablespoonfuls of good and very
clear stock, and complete the cooking of the whole.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poële</a></i> the neck of lamb, which should have been
shortened and trimmed in the usual way. Dish the neck of
lamb and serve the vegetables in the <i>cocotte</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1367—Carré d’Agneau Soubise"><a id="rcp.1367"
 >1367—CARRÉ D’AGNEAU SOUBISE</a></h3>

<p>Having shortened and trimmed the neck of lamb, stiffen it
in butter; surround it with one-half lb. of finely-minced and
well-<a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a> onions, and complete the cooking of both by
stewing.</p>

<p>This done, transfer the neck to a dish and keep it hot. Add
one-quarter pint of boiling Béchamel sauce to the onions, and
rub them quickly through tammy or a fine sieve. Heat this
Soubise; finish it with one and one-half oz. of butter, and pour
it over the neck.</p>

<p>Border the dish with a thread of rather light meat glaze,
and serve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1368—Carré d’Agneau à la Toscane"><a id="rcp.1368"
 >1368—CARRÉ D’AGNEAU <span class="nw">A LA TOSCANE</span></a></h3>

<p>Shorten the neck of lamb; suppress the cartilaginous portions
and stiffen it in butter. Garnish the bottom of an oval earthenware
dish, of the same size as the neck, with a layer of Anna
potatoes (No. <a href="#rcp.2203">2203</a>). Set the neck on this layer, and cover it
<a id="png.470" href="#png.470"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>452<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>over with a second layer of the same potato preparation.
Sprinkle with grated Parmesan; cook in the oven as for Anna
potatoes, and take care that the bottom be so well set as to
prevent any of the juices of the joint from exuding and depositing
on it.</p>

<p>Serve the dish as it stands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1369—Leg and Shoulder of Lamb"><a id="rcp.1369"
 >1369—LEG AND SHOULDER OF LAMB</a></h3>

<p>All the recipes given under Haunch and Double (pair of
legs), may be applied to the legs and shoulders of house lamb.</p>

<p>The shoulders are often grilled, the operation being effected
over a moderate fire after the joints have been incised lattice-fashion,
and the same applies to the breast. The “à la
Boulangère” treatment (No. <a href="#rcp.1307">1307</a>) admirably suits the legs and
shoulders of house lamb.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1370—Cutlets"><a id="rcp.1370"
 >1370—CUTLETS</a></h3>

<p>According to custom, lamb cutlets are usually served like
“Noisettes,” <i>i.e.</i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->, two are allowed for each person.</p>

<p>As a rule, when they are to be grilled, they are previously
dipped in melted butter and sprinkled with fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>When they are to be <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> they are treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> (egg
and bread-crumbs) except when, subject to their mode of preparation,
they have to be served plain or stuffed.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1371—Côtelettes d’Agneau de Lait à la Buloz"><a id="rcp.1371"
 >1371—CÔTELETTES D’AGNEAU DE LAIT <span class="nw">A LA BULOZ</span></a></h3>

<p><span class="nw">Prepare:—</span>(1) a rizotto (No. <a href="#rcp.2238">2238</a>) with truffles, in proportion
to the number of cutlets; (2) some very reduced Béchamel
sauce, combined with one-half oz. of grated Parmesan per one-fifth
pint of the sauce, and allowing one small tablespoonful of it
for each cutlet.</p>

<p>Half-grill the cutlets; dry them, and cover them, on both
sides, with the reduced sauce. As soon as the cutlets have
received their coat of sauce, dip them, one by one, into beaten
egg (<a href="#g_anglaise_3"><i>anglaise</i></a>); roll them in very fine bread-crumbs mixed with
grated Parmesan. Thoroughly press this coating of bread-crumbs
with the flat of a knife, that it may adhere well to the
egg and produce a crust at the close of the operation. This
done, set the cutlets in a sautépan of very hot, clarified butter,
and brown them on both sides.</p>

<p>Dish the rizotto in a very even layer; set the cutlets in a
circle on the rice, and fix a frill to the bone of each.</p>

<p>Treat the cutlets <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and cook them in clarified
butter.</p>

<p>Dish them in a circle, with a fine slice of truffle upon each;
<a id="png.471" href="#png.471"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Treat the cutlets <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, but add to the bread-crumbs
the quarter of their weight of grated Parmesan.</p>

<p>Cook the cutlets in clarified butter. Dish them in a circle,
and, in their midst, arrange a garnish “à la milanaise” (see
Côte de Veau<!-- TN: original reads "Vau" --> à la Milanaise,<!-- TN: superfluous double quote removed --> No. <a href="#rcp.1258">1258</a>.)</p>

 >1374—CÔTELETTES D’AGNEAU DE LAIT<br
 >MORLAND</a></h3>

<p>Slightly flatten the cutlets, dip them in beaten egg, and roll
them in finely-chopped truffle, which in this case answers the
purpose of bread-crumbs. Press the truffle with the flat of a
knife, that it may thoroughly combine with the egg, and cook
the cutlets in clarified butter. Dish them in a circle; garnish
the centre of the dish with a mushroom purée (No. <a href="#rcp.2059">2059</a>), and
surround the cutlets with a thread of buttered meat glaze.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1375—Côtelettes d’Agneau de Lait Navarraise"><a id="rcp.1375"
 >1375—CÔTELETTES D’AGNEAU DE LAIT<br
 >NAVARRAISE</a></h3>

<p>For twelve cutlets, make a preparation consisting of four oz. of ham, four oz. of cooked mushrooms, and one-half oz. of
chopped, red capsicums; the whole being cohered by means of
a very reduced Béchamel sauce, flavoured with truffle essence.</p>

<p>Grill the cutlets on one side only, and garnish them on their
grilled side with a tablespoonful of the above preparation, which
should be shaped like a dome upon them.</p>

<p>Set the cutlets upon a tray as soon as they are garnished;
sprinkle the surface of the preparation, covering them with
grated cheese and melted butter, and place them in the oven,
that their cooking may be completed and the <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> formed.
Meanwhile, toss twelve seasoned half-tomatoes in oil. Dish
these tomatoes in a circle; set a cutlet upon each, and border
with a thread of tomato sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1376—Côtelettes d’Agneau de Lait Nelson"><a id="rcp.1376"
 >1376—CÔTELETTES D’AGNEAU DE LAIT<br
 >NELSON</a></h3>

<p>Grill the cutlets, and, at the same time, prepare as many
bread-crumb <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> as there are cutlets, and of exactly the
same shape as the latter. Fry the <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> in butter, and coat
them with foie-gras purée.</p>

<p>Place a grilled cutlet on each coated <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûton</a></i>, and a slice
of truffle on the kernel of each cutlet. Now, by means of a
<a id="png.472" href="#png.472"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>454<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>piping-bag, fitted with an even pipe, cover the cutlets with some
soufflé au Parmesan (No. <a href="#rcp.2295a">2295a</a><!-- TN: original reads "2295A" -->); dish them in a circle, and
put them in the oven for five minutes, that the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> may
poach.</p>

<p>After withdrawing them from the oven, garnish the centre
of the dish with a heap of asparagus-heads, cohered with butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1377—Côtelettes d’Agneau de Lait Farcies à la Périgueux"><a id="rcp.1377"
 >1377—CÔTELETTES D’AGNEAU DE LAIT FARCIES <span class="nw">A LA PÉRIGUEUX</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook the cutlets in butter on one side only, and cool them
under slight pressure.</p>

<p>Garnish the cooked side of each with a tablespoonful of
forcemeat with butter (No. <a href="#rcp.193">193</a>), which should have received a
copious addition of chopped truffles. Shape this forcemeat
dome-fashion, by means of the flat of a small knife, dipped in
tepid water, and set the cutlets, one by one, on a tray. Now
put them in the front of the oven for seven or eight minutes
that the forcemeat may be poached.</p>

<p>Dish them in a circle, and pour a Périgueux sauce in their
midst.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1378—Epigrammes d’Agneau"><a id="rcp.1378"
 >1378—EPIGRAMMES D’AGNEAU</a></h3>

<p>A lamb “epigram” consists of a cutlet, and a piece of
braised breast, cooled under slight pressure and cut to the shape
of a heart of the same size as the cutlets. The cutlets and the
pieces of breast must be treated <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> or
grilled according to circumstance.</p>

<p>Epigrams should be dished in a circle, the cutlets and the
pieces being alternated.</p>

<p>They are usually garnished with braised chicory, or <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoines</a></i>
of early-season vegetables.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1379—Ris d’Agneau"><a id="rcp.1379"
 >1379—RIS D’AGNEAU</a></h3>

<p>Lamb sweetbreads are, according to circumstances, either
used as the principal constituent of various preparations, or they
answer the purpose of a garnish.</p>

<p>Due allowance having been made for their particular size,
they may be treated after the same manner as veal sweetbreads;
that is to say, once they have been cleared of blood, they are
<i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> and braised according to the nature of the selected
mode of preparation.</p>

<p>If they are to form part of a large garnish, cohered by means
of a brown sauce, they are braised brown and glazed. If they
stand as an adjunct to poached fowl, they may be either studded
or left plain, and braised white.</p>

<p>Apart from their two uses as principal and garnishing
<a id="png.473" href="#png.473"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>455<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>constituents, the undermentioned methods of preparation, explained

<p>Prepare the following <span class="nw">garnish:—</span>Twenty new carrots, cut to
the shape of large olives, cooked in consommé and glazed;
twenty pieces of turnip, similarly treated; fifteen small, new
onions, cooked in butter; twenty very small new potatoes,
cooked in butter (or <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a> if desired); three tablespoonfuls
of peas; the same quantity of French beans cut into lozenge-form,
and an equal quantity of small flageolet beans. The
three last vegetables should be cooked <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and kept
rather firm.</p>

<p>Cut two lbs. of shoulder and breast of lamb into pieces
weighing two oz., and completely cook them in butter without
any moistening.</p>

<p>This done, transfer them to a dish. Swill the saucepan with
three tablespoonfuls of water; add five tablespoonfuls of pale
meat glaze; heat without boiling, and finish with two and one-half oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Put the pieces of lamb and the vegetables into this sauce,
and gently rock the saucepan, that all the ingredients may partake
of the sauce.</p>

<p>Serve in a hot timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1381—Pilaw d’Agneau"><a id="rcp.1381"
 >1381—PILAW D’AGNEAU</a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as explained under “Pilaw de Mouton”
(No. <a href="#rcp.1354">1354</a>), only bear in mind that the time allowed for cooking
should be proportionately shortened in view of the greater tenderness
of lamb’s meat.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1385—Fresh Neck of Pork"><a id="rcp.1385"
 >1385—FRESH NECK OF PORK</a></h3>


<p>Relevés of fresh pork are only served at family and bourgeois
meals. They are always roasts and allow of all the dry or fresh
vegetable garnishes, as well as the various vegetable purées, and
the pastes, such as macaroni, noodles, polenta, gnochi, &amp;c. I
shall, therefore, give only a few recipes, and shall select Fresh
Neck of Pork as the typical joint.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1386—Fresh Neck of Pork à la Choucroûte"><a id="rcp.1386"
 >1386—FRESH NECK OF PORK <span class="nw">A LA CHOUCROÛTE</span></a></h3>

<p>Roast the neck of pork and withdraw it from the oven a few
minutes before it is done.</p>

<p>Keep it in the stove for an hour, that its cooking may be
completed gently; but remember, that if a stove is not available,
the cooking of the piece should be well finished in the
oven; for pork is indigestible when it is not thoroughly well
cooked.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, prepare a garnish of sauerkraut (No. <a href="#rcp.2097">2097</a>), and,
during the last hour of its cooking, sprinkle it frequently with
the fat of the neck.</p>

<p>Dish the neck; clear the sauerkraut of any superfluous fat,
and set it round the piece of meat in spoonfuls; slightly pressing
it in so doing.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1387—Fresh Neck of Pork with Brussels Sprouts"><a id="rcp.1387"
 >1387—FRESH NECK OF PORK WITH BRUSSELS SPROUTS</a></h3>

<p>Roast the neck of pork. Three-parts cook the Brussels
sprouts; completely drain them, and put them round the piece
of meat, that they may complete their cooking in its gravy and
fat, being frequently basted the while.</p>

<p>For this preparation it is well to roast the neck in an earthenware
dish, in which it may be served with its garnish—a much
better plan than that of transferring it to another dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1388—Fresh Neck of Pork with Red Cabbage à la Flamande"><a id="rcp.1388"
 >1388—FRESH NECK OF PORK WITH RED CABBAGE <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>Roast the neck of pork; dish it and surround it with a
garnish of red cabbages, prepared à la Flamande (No. <a href="#rcp.2098">2098</a>).</p>

<p><a id="png.475" href="#png.475"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>457<span class="ns">]<br

<h3 class="recipe" title="1389—Fresh Neck of Pork with Stewed Apples"><a id="rcp.1389"
 >1389—FRESH NECK OF PORK WITH STEWED APPLES</a></h3>

<p>Roast the neck of pork and see that it is well done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, peel and mince one lb. of apples; put them in
a saucepan with one oz. of sugar and a few tablespoonfuls of
water; seal the lid of the saucepan well down, so as to concentrate
the steam inside, and cook quickly. When about to
serve, thoroughly work the apple purée with a wire whisk, in
order to smooth it. Dish the neck with its gravy, three-parts
cleared of grease, and serve the apple purée separately in a
timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1390—Fresh Neck of Pork à la Soissonnaise"><a id="rcp.1390"
 >1390—FRESH NECK OF PORK <span class="nw">A LA SOISSONNAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Roast the neck on a dish that may be sent to the table.</p>

<p>When it is three-parts done, set one quart of cooked and
well-drained haricot beans round it, and complete the cooking
gently. Serve the dish as it stands.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1391—Boiled Salted Pork à l’Anglaise"><a id="rcp.1391"
 >1391—BOILED SALTED PORK <span class="nw">A L’ANGLAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook plainly in water three lbs. of shoulder, breast, or
gammon of bacon, and add thereto a garnish of vegetables as
for boiled beef, and six parsnips.</p>

<p>Serve the vegetables round the piece of meat, and send a
pease-pudding (prepared as directed below) separately.</p>

<p><i>Pease-pudding</i>: put one lb. of a purée of yellow or green,
split peas into a basin, and mix therewith three oz. of melted
or softened butter, three eggs, a pinch of salt, another of pepper,
and a little nutmeg. Pour this purée into a pudding basin, and
poach it in steam or in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>This preparation may also be put into a buttered and flour-dusted
napkin; in which case, close the napkin up purse-fashion,
tying it up securely with string, and cook the pudding in the
same stewpan with the pork. This procedure is simpler than
the first and quite as good.</p>

<p>Very often a purée prepared from split, yellow or green peas,
is used instead of the pudding given above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1392—Pork Pie"><a id="rcp.1392"

<h3 class="recipe" title="1397—Sucking Pig"><a id="rcp.1397"
 >1397—SUCKING PIG</a></h3>

<p>Stuffed or not stuffed, sucking pigs are always roasted whole,
and the essential point of the procedure is that they should be
just done when their skin is crisp and golden.</p>

<p>While cooking, they should be frequently basted with oil;
the latter being used in preference to any other fatty substance
owing to the greater crispness it gives to the skin of the sucking
pig.</p>

<p>Serve a sauceboat of good gravy at the same time.</p>

<p>For a sucking pig of medium weight, prepare the following
<span class="nw">forcemeat:—</span>Cook three lbs. of large onions with their skins,
and let them cool. This done, peel and finely chop them, and
put them in a basin with one lb. of the chopped fat of kidney
of beef, one lb. of soaked and well-pressed bread-crumb, four oz. of parboiled and chopped sage, two eggs, one oz. of salt,
a pinch of pepper and a little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well, and put this stuffing inside the sucking
pig. Sew up the latter’s belly; put it on the spit, and roast as
directed above.</p>

<p>Serve separately, either a timbale of apple sauce or of mashed
potatoes. Four oz. per lb. of selected raisins, washed and
swelled in tepid water, are sometimes combined with the apple
sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1399—Zampino de Modène"><a id="rcp.1399"
 >1399—ZAMPINO DE MODÈNE</a></h3>

<p>Zampino, or stuffed leg of pork, is a product of Italian
pork-butchery.</p>

<p>It is cooked like a ham, after having been tied in a napkin
lest its skin burst.</p>

<p>Served hot, it is accompanied by a Madeira or tomato sauce,
a garnish of boiled, braised, or <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratined</a></i> cabbages; of French
beans, or of potato purée.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1400—Zampino Froid"><a id="rcp.1400"
 >1400—ZAMPINO FROID</a></h3>

<p>Zampino is served cold, alone or mixed with other meats;

<p>After having singed and well cleaned the inside of the pig’s
ears, cook them in water, salted to the extent of one-third oz.
of salt per quart, together with a garnish of vegetables as for
pot-au-feu. This done, cut them across in suchwise as to have
the end where the flesh is thickest on one side, and the thinnest
end on the other side of the strips.</p>

<p>Chop up the thick portion; cut the other into collops, and put
the whole into a saucepan with one-quarter pint of half-glaze
with Madeira.</p>

<p>Cook gently for thirty minutes. This done, add to the
minced ears, one and one-half lbs. of sausage meat and a pinch
of chopped parsley. Divide up the whole into portions, weighing
three oz; wrap each portion in a piece of pig’s caul, insert a
collop of ear into the wrapping, and give the latter the shape of
ordinary <i><a href="#g_crepinettes">crépinettes</a></i>. Grill gently, until the cooking is three-parts
done; sprinkle with butter and raspings, and complete the
cooking of the <i><a href="#g_crepinettes">crépinettes</a></i>, colouring them in so doing.</p>

<p>Dish in a circle, and serve a Madeira sauce at the same time.</p>

<p>Cut them in two, lengthwise; coat them with mustard;
sprinkle them with melted butter and raspings, and grill them
gently.</p>

<p>Ears are usually served plain, but they may be accompanied

<p>Chop and afterwards pound one-half lb. of very lean fresh
pork, and three-quarters lb. of fat fresh bacon. Add one and
one-half oz. of foie gras, and rub through a fine sieve.</p>

<p>Put this forcemeat into a basin, and finish it with two fresh
eggs; one and one-half oz. of chopped onion, cooked in butter
without colouration; one-sixth pint of thick cream; one-half oz.
of salt, a pinch of white pepper, and a little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well; put it into the gut, without overfilling
the latter, and tie round with string at regular intervals. Now
set the boudins on a willow lattice, and plunge them into a
receptacle full of boiling water. From this moment keep the
water at 203° F., and let the boudins poach for twelve minutes.
This done, withdraw them, and let them cool.</p>

<p>Before serving them, grill them very gently, and, as a precautionary
measure, wrap them in buttered paper. Do not
<i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> them, but prick them with a pin.</p>

<p>Serve a purée of potatoes with cream at the same time.</p>

<p>Pound separately one lb. of raw chicken fillets and three-quarters lb. of fresh fat bacon.</p>

<p>Combine the two products in the mortar; pound again with
the view of thoroughly mixing them, and add three oz. of
chopped onion, cooked in butter without colouration, together
with a little thyme and bay; one-half oz. of salt, a pinch of
white pepper, and a little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well, and add four eggs, one by one, working
the forcemeat vigorously the while with the pestle.</p>

<p>Rub through a fine sieve; return the forcemeat to the mortar,
and add thereto, little by little, one pint of boiled and very
cold milk.</p>

<p>Put the forcemeat into the gut; poach it in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>,

 </span></span></a>two-thirds oz. of salt, a pinch of pepper, and a little spice;
a pinch of wild-thyme leaves, and a leaf of bay, both chopped.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well with one pint of blood of pork, and put it
into the gut without over-filling it, for it should be borne in
mind that the preparation swells in poaching.</p>

<p>Set the boudins on willow lattices or baskets; plunge them
into boiling water, and, from that time, keep the latter at
203° F.</p>

<p>Let them poach for twenty minutes, and remember to prick
all those that, by rising to the surface, show they contain air,
which might burst their skins. When about to serve them,
<i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> them on both sides, and grill them very gently.</p>

<p>They are generally accompanied by a potato purée with

<p>Formerly, the above was the mode of procedure, but nowadays
the <a href="#g_crepinettes">crépinettes</a> are merely enveloped, each in an oval
layer of paste. They are then <i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i>, their tops are streaked,

<h3 class="recipe" title="1412—Saucisses Anglaises"><a id="rcp.1412"
 >1412—SAUCISSES ANGLAISES</a></h3>

<p>The most well-known of English sausages are those of
Cambridge.</p>

<p>They are cooked like the French kind, and they are often
served at breakfasts as an adjunct to bacon. Sometimes, too,
they serve as a garnish to roast fowls, young turkeys, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Their seasoning is often excessive.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1413—Saucisses au Vin Blanc"><a id="rcp.1413"
 >1413—SAUCISSES AU VIN BLANC</a></h3>

<p><i>First Method.</i>—Put the sausages in a well-buttered sautépan;
poach them gently in the oven, and dish them on thin
crusts of bread fried in butter.</p>

<p>For twelve sausages, swill the sautépan with one-sixth pint
of white wine; reduce this to half; add one-sixth pint of half-glaze
sauce; boil for a few minutes, and finish, away from the
fire, with one and one-half oz. of butter. Pour this sauce over
the sausages.</p>

<p><i>Second Method.</i>—Stiffen the sausages in butter; add one-third
pint of white wine, and complete their poaching. Set
them on fried crusts; reduce the wine by two-thirds, and add
thereto the yolk of one egg, a few drops of lemon juice, two
tablespoonfuls of pale melted meat-glaze, and three oz. of
butter. Pour the sauce over the sausages.</p>

<p>Plunge the sausages into a saucepanful of boiling water, and
then poach them for no more than ten minutes; should they
be allowed to cook for a longer time, they would only lose their
quality.</p>

<p>They may be served with a hors-d’œuvre dish of grated
horse-radish, and an apple sauce separately; but their proper
adjunct is braised sauerkraut.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>464<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Ham.</h3>

<p>However deservedly pork may be praised, it could never
have been included among the preparations of first-class cookery
(except subsidiarily) had it not been for the culinary value of
hams.</p>

<p>With the latter it triumphs, and, be they of Bayonne or
York, of Prague or Westphalia, no other joints enjoy more
favour than these as Relevés.</p>

<p>Though it is somewhat difficult to decide which one of the
various kinds of ham should be adopted, in my opinion that
of Bohemia, known as Prague ham, is best for a warm dish,
and that of York for a cold dish.</p>

<p>The latter is also excellent when served hot, but, even so,
for this purpose it is inferior to the Prague kind, the delicacy
of which is incomparable.</p>

<p>Still, York ham ranks first in the opinion of many, for it
should be remembered that England has no rival in the preparation
of seasoned pork, and her famous bacon, the renown
of which is enormous, constitutes one of the greatest discoveries
in the science of gastronomy.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1415—Hot Ham—its preparation"><a id="rcp.1415"
 >1415—HOT HAM—Its Preparation</a></h3>

<p>York ham is the kind chiefly used.</p>

<p>After having soaked it in cold water for six hours, brush
it and remove the pelvic bone; put it into a stewpan of cold
water, and set to boil. This done, keep the water just simmering,
that the ham may cook after the poaching method.</p>

<p>There is no need of any seasoning or aromatic garnish. As
often as possible, leave the ham to cool in its cooking-liquor.
If the ham is to be braised, take it out of the water thirty
minutes before it is cooked. Skin it; clear it of any superfluous
fat, and put it in a braising-pan, just large enough to hold it,
with two-thirds pint of some such wine as Madeira, Port,
Xeres, Chypre, &amp;c. Select the wine in accordance with the
title of the dish on the menu.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly sealed down the lid of the pan, put it
in the oven, and continue the cooking of the ham gently for
one hour, turning it over from time to time during the operation.
If it have to reach the table whole, glaze it at the last
moment.</p>

<p>Its usual adjunct is a light and highly seasoned half-glaze
sauce, combined with some of the braising-liquor, cleared of all
grease.</p>

 >1416—JAMBON <span class="nw">A LA CHANOINESSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Having poached the ham as explained above, braise it in

<p>Dish and send separately a garnish of large, fresh noodles,
cohered with butter and a Soubise purée, and completed with
a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of truffles.</p>

<p><i>If served whole</i>, send, separately, some braised sauerkraut
and potatoes, freshly cooked <a href="#g_anglaise_2"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>. Serve a half-glaze
sauce with Rhine wine at the same time.</p>

garnish, arranged in alternate <span class="nw">heaps:—</span>Carrots and turnips,
cut to the shape of large, elongated olives, cooked separately in
consommé, and glazed; small onions cooked in butter; braised
and trimmed half-lettuces; peas and French beans cohered with

<p>Poach the ham and drain it on a dish. Remove the skin and
all the black, outside parts. Prepare a piece of patty paste
large enough to enclose the ham. Besprinkle the surface of the
ham with powdered sugar; glaze quickly at the salamander,
and place the ham (glazed side undermost) on the layer of
paste.</p>

<p>Draw the ends of the paste towards each other; seal them
together, with the help of a little moisture, in such wise as to
enclose the ham completely; turn the latter over, and put it on
a tray with the sealed side of the paste lying underneath. <i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i>
and streak, make a slit in the middle of the paste for the escape
of steam, and put the joint in the oven.</p>

<p>Leave it there until the paste is dry and well coloured. After
taking the ham out of the oven, inject into it, through a
<a id="png.484" href="#png.484"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>prepared hole, a large wineglassful of Port wine or Sherry. Stop
up the hole with a little pellet of paste; dish, and serve immediately.</p>

<p>Serve at the same time a garnish of Gnochi, spinach, or
Soufflé au Parmesan (No. <a href="#rcp.2295a">2295a</a><!-- TN: original reads "2295A" -->).</p>

<p>The best adjunct to Prague ham is a very light glaze prepared

 >1421—JAMBON SOUFFLÉ</a></h3>

<p>This is a variety of the ham <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i> given hereafter. The
preparation used is the same, and it may be made either from
raw or from cooked ham.</p>

<p>After having completely boned it, but for the end bone,
which must be kept, cook the ham, and cool it.</p>

<p>Now cut it horizontally, one-half inch above its bone, from
the extremity of the end bone to the head of the latter. At the
last-mentioned point, make a vertical incision meeting and ending
at the first; remove the cushion of ham, which should by
now be quite separated from the rest of the joint, and put aside
for some future purpose.</p>

<p><a id="png.485" href="#png.485"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>467<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>All that remains of the ham, therefore, is a thick piece
adhering to the end-bone. Carefully trim this piece, and surround
it with a strong band of buttered paper, tied on by means
of string, the purpose of which is to hold in the <a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a>.</p>

<p>This done, put a sufficient quantity of soufflé de Jambon
(described hereafter) on the remaining meat of the ham to reconstruct
it entirely. Smooth the surface of the preparation with
the flat of a knife (dipped in cold water), and so finish off the
contour of the ham. Decorate according to fancy; place the
dish containing the ham on a saucepanful of boiling water, and
put the two in the oven with the view of obtaining the maximum
amount of steam, which latter helps to poach the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i>. This
<i>souffléd</i> ham may be poached just as well in a steamer.</p>

<p>When the preparation is properly poached, remove the band
of paper; dish the ham, and send one of the garnishes or sauces
given for braised ham separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1422—Soufflés au Jambon"><a id="rcp.1422"
 >1422—SOUFFLÉS AU JAMBON</a></h3>

<p>Ham <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i> are prepared after two recipes; in the first,
cooked ham is used, and in the second the ham is raw. This
last procedure is derived from <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat, and, inasmuch
as the preparation resulting from it is less flimsy than
that of the first, it is preferred when a large number of people
have to be served.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1423—The Preparation of the Soufflé with Cooked Ham"><a id="rcp.1423"
 >1423—THE PREPARATION OF THE SOUFFLÉ WITH COOKED HAM</a></h3>

<p>Finely pound one lb. of lean, cooked ham, and add thereto,
one after the other, three tablespoonfuls of very cold Béchamel
sauce. Rub through a fine sieve; put the resulting purée into a
sautépan, and finish with one-quarter pint of very creamy and
boiling Béchamel sauce, flavoured with ham essence; four egg-yolks,
and the whites of six eggs, beaten to a stiff froth.</p>

<p>This preparation may be combined with three oz. of grated
Parmesan, and the two flavours will be found to blend very
agreeably.</p>

<p>Prepared in this way, it is particularly well suited to the
“Jambon Soufflé,” the recipe whereof is given above
(No. <a href="#rcp.1421">1421</a>).</p>

 </span></span></a>tablespoonfuls of reduced and very cold Béchamel sauce per lb. of raw ham.</p>

<p>Keep the forcemeat somewhat stiff, and finish it with the
whites of four eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, per lb. of ham.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1425—Soufflé de Jambon Alexandra"><a id="rcp.1425"

<p>Make the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> preparation after one of the methods given
above. Spread it in layers in a buttered timbale, alternating
the layers of <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> with others of asparagus-heads cohered with
butter. Smooth the surface to the shape of a dome; decorate
with a fine slice of truffle, and cook in a moderate oven, of a
temperature suited to this kind of preparation. Serve the
<i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> as soon as it is ready. If it be small, spread only one
layer of asparagus-heads in the middle of it.</p>

<p>If it be large, spread two or three layers of asparagus-heads.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1426—Soufflé de Jambon Carmen"><a id="rcp.1426"

<p>Add to the selected one of the two <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> preparations—either
will do—for one lb. of ham, the purée of one-half lb.
of pressed tomatoes, cooked in butter with one half-capsicum,
rubbed through a sieve and very much reduced.</p>

<p>Dish the <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> in a buttered timbale; sprinkle the surface

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.1430"
 >1430—MOUSSES ET MOUSSELINES CHAUDES <span class="nw">DE JAMBON</span></a></h3>

<p><i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a></i> and <i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousselines</a></i> are made from the same preparation
as “Farce mousseline de jambon,” in pursuance of the
general principles given under No. <a href="#rcp.195">195</a>.</p>

<p>The need of differentiating the terms arises from the fact
that <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> are poached in a mould the contents of which are
sufficient for a number of people, whereas <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> are spoon-moulded
quenelles, shaped like eggs.</p>

<p>In the preparation of “Farce mousseline de jambon” it is
necessary to allow, in the salt seasoning, for the amount of
salting the ham has already received.</p>

<p>If the meat of the ham is not very red, the colour of the
forcemeat may be intensified by means of a little vegetable
red, in order that it may be of a distinct pink shade.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1431—Treatment and Accompaniment of Ham Mousse"><a id="rcp.1431"
 >1431—TREATMENT AND ACCOMPANIMENT OF HAM MOUSSE</a></h3>

<p>Put the forcemeat in a deep border-mould, somewhat like a
Charlotte, and poach it under cover in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>That the poaching may be regular, keep in water at a constant
temperature of 205° or 208° Fahrenheit, and allow forty-five
minutes for the operation in the case of a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> made in
a quart mould.</p>

<p>The preparation is seen to be cooked when it swells and
rises in the mould.</p>

<p>As soon as this occurs, withdraw the latter from the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>;
let it stand for five minutes, that its contents may settle;
turn it upside-down on a dish, and wait two minutes before
removing the mould. In any case, do not take off the mould
until the liquid which has drained from it, all round the dish,
has been soaked up. Ham <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> are chiefly accompanied
by Suprême sauce, or Veloutés with curry or paprika; sometimes,
too, a highly-seasoned and buttered half-glaze sauce,
with Madeira, Port, or Marsala may be used. The most suitable
garnishes for ham <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> are those I have already given
for Ham.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1432—Treatment and Poaching of Ham Mousselines"><a id="rcp.1432"
 >1432—TREATMENT AND POACHING OF HAM MOUSSELINES</a></h3>

<p>As I have already stated, <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>, like quenelles, are
moulded with a spoon.</p>

<p>They may also be laid, by means of a piping-bag, on the
bottom of the well-buttered sautépan in which they are to be
poached; they are shaped like <a href="#g_meringue">meringues</a>, even or grooved,
<a id="png.488" href="#png.488"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>470<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and, in either case, they are decorated with lozenges, crescents,
or discs, &amp;c., of ham or truffle.</p>

<p>Having carried out the selected method of preparation,
cover them with boiling water, salted to the extent of one-third oz. per quart, and poach them for from eighteen to twenty
minutes, taking care to keep the water at a constant temperature
of 208° F. These <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> may also be poached dry in a
steamer or in a drying stove.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1433—Mousselines de Jambon Alexandra"><a id="rcp.1433"
 >1433—MOUSSELINES DE JAMBON ALEXANDRA</a></h3>

<p>Decorate the <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>, prepared according to one of the
two methods above described, with one lozenge of ham and
another of truffle. Poach them; drain them well, and dish
them in the form of a crown. Cover them with an Allemande
sauce, flavoured with ham essence, and combined with two oz.
of grated Parmesan per pint of the sauce, and glaze quickly.</p>

<p>After taking the <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i> out of the oven, set in their
midst a heap of asparagus-heads, cohered with butter.</p>

<p>Spread a layer of shredded spinach, fried in butter, on a
dish.</p>

<p>Upon it set the poached and well-drained <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousselines</a></i>; cover

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XVI<br
 ><small class="allsc">POULTRY (VOLAILLE)<!-- TN: original has period --></small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">Although</span> the term “poultry” (Fr. volaille), in its general
sense, implies Turkeys, Geese, Ducks and Pigeons, just as well
as Fowls, only the latter are meant, from the culinary standpoint,
when the word “Volaille” appears on a menu.</p>

<p>Four qualities of fowl are recognised in cookery, and each
plays its part, has its uses, and is quite distinct from the other
three. We <span class="nw">have:—</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Pullets and capons</i>; usually served whole, either as
relevés or roasts.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Chickens</i>, so-called “à la Reine”; used for <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sautés</a></i> and
chiefly for roasts.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Spring chickens</i>; best suited to <i><a href="#g_cocotte">en cocotte</a></i> or grilled
preparations.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Chicks</i>; served only <i><a href="#g_cocotte">en cocotte</a></i> or grilled.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_supreme">Suprêmes</a></i> and <a href="#g_ailerons"><i>ailerons</i></a> of fowl, which are among the finest
entrées, are supplied by chickens à la Reine or by Spring
chickens.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the giblets, consisting of the pinions,
necks, gizzards, and livers of fowl, which give rise to a number
of preparations, the recipes whereof I shall give briefly at the
end of the series.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1443—Pullets and Capons for Relevés"><a id="rcp.1443"
 >1443—PULLETS AND CAPONS FOR RELEVÉS</a></h3>

<p>Pullets and capons for relevés and entrées are poached or
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i>; sometimes, but more rarely, they are braised.</p>

<p>The birds to be treated by poaching are trussed with the
claws folded back and inserted into the belly; their fillets and
legs are rubbed with lemon, so as to keep them white, and they
are then covered with thin slices of larding bacon.</p>

<p>The ingredients for chicken poaching stock were given under
No. <a href="#rcp.249">249</a>. The bird is known to be cooked when the blood
which issues from a prick on the leg is white or faintly pink.</p>

<p>These fowls are sometimes larded or studded. When this is
to be done, dip the legs and belly of a trussed and
<a id="png.492" href="#png.492"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>474<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lemon-rubbed fowl into boiling white stock; this will be found to
sufficiently harden the flesh to allow of its being treated in the
required way. The products used for studding and larding are,
according to circumstances, ham or tongue, truffles or mushrooms,
and sometimes, the red part of a carrot for the larding.
Only truffles, ham and tongue are used for studding.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poëled</a> fowls</i> are trussed as above; they are covered with
slices of bacon in order that the fillets may be protected during
the first stages of the cooking; then they are cooked in butter
on <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>-aromatics, under cover and in a deep, thick saucepan.
When the piece is almost cooked, just moisten it a little,
either with rich poultry-stock, with the cooking-liquor of truffles
or mushrooms, with Madeira, red or white wine, &amp;c. This
moistening serves in the basting of the fowl and must therefore
be renewed if it reduces too quickly. After having been
cleared of all grease, it is always added to the sauce which
accompanies the piece of poultry.</p>

<p><i>Braised fowls</i> are always treated after the manner described
under No. <a href="#rcp.248">248</a>; they are not rubbed with lemon, but they are
covered with slices of bacon. The latter should only cover the
breast, but be thick, notwithstanding; for they protect the belly,
which, without them, would shrivel by the time the legs cooked.</p>

<p>The covering of bacon is essential to all pieces of poultry,
whether these be poached, <a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a>, braised or roasted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1444—The Way to Serve Poultry Relevés Quickly and Hot"><a id="rcp.1444"
 >1444—THE WAY TO SERVE POULTRY RELEVÉS QUICKLY <span class="nw">AND HOT</span></a></h3>

<p>I feel bound to call the reader’s attention to this very important
point in culinary <span class="nw">work:—</span></p>

<p>Owing to the difficulties involved in the carving of the fowl
and the placing and arranging of the pieces and their garnish
upon the consumers’ plates—both of which operations require
dexterity and expertness, which those in charge very often do
not possess, or thanks to the inefficiency of particular installations,
or what not, I have noticed for some considerable time,
that the method of serving large pieces of poultry is, in many
cases, very far from being the right one.</p>

<p>For, indeed, how often does not the diner find himself presented
with a plate of fowl which is neither appetisingly dainty
nor yet sufficiently hot! It follows from this, that all the care
and trouble devoted by a chef to the preparation of the dish are
entirely wasted. Now, I have tried to improve this state of
affairs, by planning a method of serving which would be at
once simple and expeditious, without necessarily being devoid
of tastefulness and presentability.</p>

<p><a id="png.493" href="#png.493"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>475<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In the first place, it is my practice to remove the fowl’s two
<i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, in the kitchen, and to keep them warm in a little
cooking-liquor until the last minute. Secondly, I remove all
the bones of the breast, and I reconstruct the fowl with a
garnish in keeping with the dish, <i>i.e.</i>, either a <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat,
pilaff rice combined with cream, foie gras and truffles,
spaghetti, or noodles with cream.</p>

<p>Having properly smoothed and arranged the selected garnish,
the fowl may now be placed, either at one end of any but
a round dish, or on a low cushion of fried bread, on which it
may be set firmly.</p>

<p>It may also be entirely coated with Mornay sauce, sprinkled
with grated cheese, and speedily glazed.</p>

<p>When the body of the bird is dished, its garnish should be
set round it in fine, tartlet crusts; its <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, quickly sliced,
should be distributed among the tartlets, and the dish sent to
the table with the sauce separately.</p>

<p>By this means, it reaches the table hot, it is served quickly
and cleanly; and every person gets a slice of meat, and not
garnish only, as was so often the case formerly.</p>

<p>Instead of tartlets, one may use thin <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread, of
the size of the slices of chicken, and fried in fresh butter.</p>

<p>Thus, for a “Poularde à la Derby,” after having stuffed
the pullet with rice, suppressed the bones of the breast, and
removed the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>; all that is necessary is to properly shape
the rice, and to dish the fowl on a cushion.</p>

<p>This done, prepare as many <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> and slices of foie-gras,
<i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> in butter, as there are diners, and arrange them
round the pullet—the slices of foie-gras lying on the <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i>.
Now, quickly cut the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> into slices; put one of these
on each slice of foie-gras, and on each of the latter put a slice
of truffle. Put the pullet, thus prepared, in the oven for a few
minutes; let it get very hot, and send it to the table with the
sauce separately.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the Maître-d’hôtel quickly serves the
garnished <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> on hot plates, beside each <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûton</a></i> he puts
a tablespoonful of the rice with which the pullet has been stuffed,
and, finally, a tablespoonful of sauce.</p>

<p>In less than two minutes after its entrance into the dining-room,
the pullet is thus served warm to each person.</p>

<p>Of course, the above measures refer to the fowl that has to
be dished whole and presented; but, when this is not required,
the rice withdrawn from the cooked bird need only be set
in the centre of a deep, square entrée dish (fitted with a cover),
<a id="png.494" href="#png.494"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>476<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and surrounded by the sliced <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, with intercalated slices
of foie-gras and truffle. The sauce is also served separately in
this case. Cover the dish, so that it may stand and keep hot
a few minutes, if necessary, without spoiling.</p>

<p>The legs, which are rarely served at a well-ordered dinner,
remain in the kitchen together with the carcass.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly recommend the system just described,
whenever the circumstances allow of its being put into practice.
It is the only one that ensures an efficient service, calculated
to give entire satisfaction to all concerned.</p>

half its weight of very fine sausage-meat.</p>

<p>In the middle of the pullet set a nice salted and cooked
calf’s tongue, trimmed and cleared of all cartilage; and place
it so that its thin end lies in the region of the bird’s tail.</p>

<p>Sew up the pullet’s belly with thin string, allowing the skin
sufficient play not to tear under the pressure of the forcemeat,

together with one of the truffles inserted into the pullet at the
start.</p>

<p>Assistant No. 2, to whom the plate is handed forthwith, adds
an ortolan and a little juice, and then assistant No. 3 straightway
places the plate before the diner.</p>

<p>The pullet is thus served very quickly, and in such wise as
to render it a dish of very exceptional gastronomical quality.</p>

<p>N.B.—The name “Sainte Alliance” which I give to this
dish (a name that Brillat-Savarin employs in his “Physiology
<a id="png.510" href="#png.510"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>492<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of Taste” in order to identify a certain famous toast) struck
me as an admirable title for a preparation in which four such
veritable gems of cookery are found united—the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> of a
fine pullet, foie gras, truffles, and ortolans.</p>

<p>This dish was originally served at the Carlton Hotel in 1905.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1516—Poularde Santa-Lucia"><a id="rcp.1516"
 >1516—POULARDE SANTA-LUCIA</a></h3>

<p>Stuff the pullet with truffles, prepared as for No. <a href="#rcp.1515">1515</a>, and
braise it in Marsala. Dish it on a low cushion, and surround
it with small tartlets of Gnochi “à la Romaine,” alternated with
collops of foie gras, tossed in butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1517—Poularde Sicilienne"><a id="rcp.1517"
 >1517—POULARDE SICILIENNE</a></h3>

<p>Poach the pullet.</p>

<p>Raise the fillets, leaving the wing-bones on the carcass;
suppress the breast bones, and fill the resulting cavity with
macaroni, cohered with the strong liquor of braised beef “à la
Napolitaine,” and combined with dice of truffles and foie gras,
cocks’ combs and kidneys.</p>

<p>Envelop the piece in pig’s caul, giving the former its natural
shape; sprinkle with raspings and melted butter, and set in
the oven that the pig’s caul may cook and colour.</p>

<p>Dish on a low cushion, and coat with chicken glaze with
butter.</p>

<p>Surround with tartlet crusts, each garnished with a slice of
the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, covered with a slice of foie gras tossed in butter,
and surmounted by a slice of truffle.</p>

<p>Send a chicken glaze with butter separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1518—Poularde Soufflée"><a id="rcp.1518"
 >1518—POULARDE SOUFFLÉE</a></h3>

<p>Poach the pullet.</p>

<p>Raise the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, and cut them into thin slices; suppress
the breast-bones by means of scissors, and stuff the bird with
one lb. two oz. of <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat of chicken, combined
with one-third lb. of foie-gras purée. Spread this preparation
in layers, and between each of the latter set alternate slices of
<i><a href="#g_supreme">suprême</a></i> and truffle.</p>

<p>Reconstruct the bird exactly; smooth its surface; deck it
with bits of truffle, salted tongue, and boiled white of egg;
place the dish on a deep tray containing a little boiling water,
the steam of which assists the poaching of the preparation, and
poach in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>When about to serve, coat the pullet with Allemande sauce
flavoured with truffle essence.</p>

<p>N.B.—The use of a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> consisting of a deep pan
<a id="png.511" href="#png.511"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>493<span class="ns">]

pullet is placed, is highly recommended, but the ideal method
of poaching this sort of preparations is by means of a steamer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1519—Poularde Stanley"><a id="rcp.1519"

<h3 class="recipe" title="1532—Poulets Sautés"><a id="rcp.1532"
 >1532—POULETS SAUTÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>As I pointed out at the beginning of Part V. of this chapter,
the chickens best suited to the <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sauté</a></i> treatment are those termed
<a id="png.514" href="#png.514"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>496<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“à la Reine”; they should be of medium size, very fleshy, and
tender.</p>

<p>In an extreme case, small pullets or large chickens might be
used, but neither of these are so eminently suited to the procedure
in question as chickens “à la Reine.”</p>

<p>The fowl which is to be <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> should be cut up thus: after
having emptied, singed, and thoroughly cleaned it; cut off its
legs—quite a simple matter, since all that is necessary is the
disjunction of the thigh-bones, after having cut the skin. Cut
off the claws just below the joint of the tibia, and pare the
spurs. Now cut the tibia above the joint, and remove the
thigh-bone.</p>

<p>Cut the pinions at the first joint; remove the wings, after
having cut round a portion of the breast in such wise that each
wing holds one half of it; finally detach the centrepiece or
breast-bone, which should be left whole if the fowl be small
and cut into two if it be otherwise.</p>

<p>The carcass thus remains. Cut it into two, and trim each
piece on both sides.</p>

<p>Before setting them to cook, moderately season the pieces of
fowl with salt and pepper. Whatever the demands of a particular
recipe may be, the preparatory principle of <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>
chickens is always as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Take a sautépan just large enough to hold the pieces of fowl,
and heat therein two oz. of clarified butter; or, according to
circumstances, half butter and half good oil. When the selected
fat is quite hot, insert the pieces of fowl; let them colour quickly,
and turn them over from time to time, that they may do so
evenly. Now cover the utensil, and put it in a sufficiently hot
oven to ensure the complete cooking of the fowl. Some tender
pieces, such as the wings and the breast, should be withdrawn
after a few minutes have elapsed, and kept warm; but the legs,
the meat of which is firmer and thicker, should cook seven or
eight minutes more at least.</p>

<p>When all the pieces are cooked, withdraw them; drain away
their butter, and swill the sautépan with the prescribed liquor,
which is either some kind of wine, mushroom cooking-liquor, or
chicken stock, &amp;c. This swilling forms, as I have already
pointed out, an essential part of the procedure, inasmuch as its
object is to dissolve those portions of solidified gravy which
adhere to the bottom of the sautépan.</p>

<p>Reduce the swilling-liquor to half, and add thereto the sauce
given in the recipe. Put the pieces of carcass, the claws, the
pinions and the legs into this sauce, and simmer for a few
<a id="png.515" href="#png.515"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>497<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>minutes. The other pieces, <i>i.e.</i>, the wings and breast, are
then added, but when the sauce is sufficiently reduced, it must
stop boiling. When the pieces are completely cooked, it is
obviously unnecessary for the sauce to boil, since the former
would only be hardened thereby.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, put the pieces into a deep
entrée dish (fitted with a cover) in the following <span class="nw">order:—</span>The
pieces of carcass, the claws and the pinions on the bottom of
the dish, upon these the legs and the breast, and, last of all, the
wings.</p>

<p>The sauce is then finished according to the directions of the
recipe, and is poured over the pieces of fowl.</p>

<p>Some chickens are prepared without colouration—that is to
say, the pieces are merely stiffened in butter without browning,
and their cooking is completed in the oven as above. In this
case the swilling-liquor is invariably white, as also the supplementary
sauces, and the latter are finished with cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1533—Poulet Sauté Archiduc"><a id="rcp.1533"
 >1533—POULET SAUTÉ ARCHIDUC</a></h3>

<p>Fry the pieces of fowl without colouration, <i>i.e.</i>, merely stiffen
them. Add four oz. of onions, previously cooked in butter, and
complete the cooking of the onions and the fowl together.</p>

hot. Moisten the onions with a small glassful of liqueur
brandy; reduce the latter; add thereto one-sixth pint of cream
and one-sixth pint of velouté, and rub through tammy.</p>

<p>Reduce this sauce to a stiff consistence; finish it, away from
the fire, with one and one-half oz. of butter, the juice of the
quarter of a lemon, and a tablespoonful of Madeira, and pour
it over the fowl.</p>

<p>Set about ten slices of truffle on the latter, and serve.</p>

<p>The terms “Fillet” and “<i>Suprême</i>” are synonymous, and
either one or the other may be used for variety to express
the same thing on a menu. They are names given to the
breast of the fowl, divided into two along the sternum, and
cleared of all skin. Each fillet or <i>suprême</i> comprises the large
and the minion fillets.</p>

<p>When <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> are taken from a small chicken, the minion
fillets are not removed; if the chicken be an ordinary one or
a pullet, the minion fillets are removed, cleared of all tendons,
and twisted into rings or crescents, after having been <a href="#g_contise"><i>contised</i></a>
with slices of truffle that are half-inserted into the little incisions,
made at regular intervals in the meat with the point of a knife.</p>

<p>Prepared in this way, these fillets are generally included in
the garnish of the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>. Chicken <i>ailerons</i> and cutlets
(the latter must not be mistaken for those prepared from cooked
meat and which are only a kind of croquette) are <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> to
which the humerus-bone of the wing is left adhering.</p>

<p>Cutlets are always cut from such fowls as chickens à la
Reine, or very fleshy, spring chickens. The same rule applies
to <a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a>: though, sometimes, the latter are cut from pullets.
But, in that case, as they would be too large, they are cut into
three or four very regular pieces, which are slightly flattened,
and trimmed to the shape of hearts or ovals; except when they
have to be stuffed.</p>

<p><a id="png.526" href="#png.526"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>508<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In the latter case, they are opened in the thickness, by means
of the point of a small knife, to form sacks; and, in the
resulting interstice the selected stuffing is inserted, with the
help of a piping-bag fitted with a little, even pipe, and in a
sufficient quantity to fill out the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> well.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_supreme">Suprêmes</a></i> and cutlets are always cooked without liquor, or
almost so; for should any moistening liquid even approach the
boil, it would immediately harden them. If they be desired
poached, it would be best to cook the whole fowl, and cut them
from the latter when it is cooked.</p>

<p>This is how they are prepared, according as to whether they
be required colourless or <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i>; though the brown method of
preparing them is applied more particularly to cutlets.</p>

<p><i>Cutlets or <a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a> <a href="#g_saute_2">sautéd</a></i>: Season them with salt; roll
them in flour; set them in a vegetable pan containing some very
hot clarified butter, and quickly <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> them on both sides. These
pieces of fowl are so tender that they are cooked and <i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i> at
the same moment of time.</p>

<p><i>Cutlets or <a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a> prepared without colouration</i>: Season
them, and set them in a vegetable-pan, containing some fresh,
melted, unclarified butter. Roll the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> in this butter;
add a few drops of lemon juice; thoroughly seal the vegetable-pan,
and put it in a very hot oven.</p>

<p>A few minutes suffice for the poaching of the <a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a>,
which are known to be ready when they seem resilient to the
touch, and are perfectly white.</p>

<p><i>Important Remarks</i>: Chicken <i><a href="#g_supreme">Suprêmes</a></i> or cutlets should
never be allowed to wait, lest they harden. They should be
cooked quickly, at the last moment; dished and served immediately.
The shortest wait is enough to spoil them, and to make
an insipid and dry preparation of what should be an exquisite
dish.</p>

<p>N.B.—The recipes given hereafter for <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> may of
course be applied to fillets, cutlets, <i>ailerons</i>, blanc de poulet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These preparations are useful for disposing of any odd legs
of fowls, the other parts of which have been already used. The
legs are boned and stuffed, and the skin, which should be purposely
left long if this preparation be contemplated, is then
sewn up. The stuffing used varies according to the kind of dish
in preparation, but good sausage-meat is most commonly used.</p>

<p>Ballotines or Jambonneaux are braised, and they may be
accompanied by any garnish suited to fowl.</p>

<p>If they be prepared for serving cold, coat them with jelly, or
cover them with brown or white chaud-froid sauce, and garnish
them according to fancy.</p>

 >1661—CRÊTES ET ROGNONS DE COQ</a></h3>

<p>In order to prepare cocks’ combs and kidneys, they should
be first set to soak in cold water for a few hours.</p>

<p>If they are fresh, they should be put in a saucepan of cold
water; the latter should be made lukewarm, and they should
then be drained and rubbed in a towel that their skins may be
removed. This done, they are trimmed, and kept in fresh water,
which ought to be frequently changed until they are quite white.</p>

<p>They may then be cooked in a very light Blanc (No. <a href="#rcp.167">167</a>).</p>

<p>The kidneys are merely soaked in cold water for a few hours,
and put to cook with the combs a few minutes before the latter
are ready.</p>

<p>Cocks’ combs and kidneys are mostly used as garnish;
nevertheless, they also serve in the preparation of special dishes,
for which I shall now give a few recipes.</p>

 >1662—CRÊTES ET ROGNONS DE COQ <span class="nw">A LA GRECQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>About twenty-five minutes before serving, prepare a pint
of pilaff rice, combined with one half-capsicum cut into dice,
and a very little saffron.</p>

<p>Also prepare ten roundels of egg-plant, seasoned, dredged,
and fried in oil just before dishing. The moment the rice
is cooked, add thereto twenty-four very fresh cocks’ kidneys,
frizzled in butter, and twelve fine <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> cocks’ combs, <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i>
after the manner of lambs’ sweetbreads.</p>

<p>Set the whole in a silver saucepan, arrange the egg-plant

<h3 class="recipe" title="1663—Desirs de Mascotte"><a id="rcp.1663"

essential that these should be fresh); season them with salt,
pepper, and a little red pepper, and cook them for from five
to six minutes, which should prove sufficient.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, prepare twelve <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumbs, one-third
inch thick, stamped out with a round cutter two-thirds
inch in diameter. Fry these <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> in butter at the last
minute.</p>

<p>Put four fine, very black truffles, cut into somewhat thick
slices, into the required quantity of reduced half-glaze sauce;
add the kidneys, drained of their butter, as well as the fried
crusts, one and one-half oz. of very best butter, and a few drops
of lemon juice, and roll the saucepan gently, that the butter may
thoroughly combine with the sauce.</p>

<p>Dish immediately in a very hot, silver timbale, and serve
instantly.</p>

<p>Choose some fine, cooked kidneys, and cut them into two
lengthwise. Trim them slightly underneath, that they may lie
steady.</p>

<p>Stuff them by means of a piping-bag with a highly seasoned
purée of foie gras, or of ham, of the white of a chicken and
truffles, combined with an equal weight of fresh butter.</p>

<p>Coat them with a pink or white chaud-froid sauce, according
to the requirements; set them in a low timbale, and cover them
with light jelly.</p>

<p>They may also be put into petits-fours moulds, surrounded
with jelly, and used as a garnish for cold fowls.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1664a—Chicken Croquettes and Cutlets"><a id="rcp.1664a"
 >1664a—CHICKEN CROQUETTES AND CUTLETS</a></h3>

<p>The croquettes and cutlets with which we are now concerned
are made up of exactly the same constituents, and only differ
in the matter of shape, the croquettes, as a rule, being shaped
either like corks or rectangles; sometimes, too, like quoits;
whereas the cutlets, as their name implies, are made in cutlet-shaped
moulds.</p>

<p>The preparation from which they are made is as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>One lb. of the meat of a poached or roast fowl, thoroughly
cleared of all skin, cartilage, and bones, and cut into small
regular dice<a id="fn1" title="Go to footnote 1" href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor"><span class="ns">[Footnote </span
 >1<span class="ns">]</span></a>; six oz. of cooked mushrooms; an equal amount
of salted ox-tongue or York ham, and four oz. of truffles. Cut
<a id="png.545" href="#png.545"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>527<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>these various products like the chicken, and mix them therewith;
then add one-half pint of very reduced and finished Allemande
sauce to the whole; set the preparation to dry for a few
minutes over an open fire; this done, remove it from the latter,
and thicken it with the yolks of four raw eggs, which should
be quickly mixed with it. Now pour the preparation into a
very clean, buttered tray, and butter its surface, lest a crust
form thereon during the cooling.</p>

<p>When the preparation is quite cold, transfer it, by means of
a spoon, in pieces weighing about two oz., to a flour-dusted
mixing board. Make the croquettes and cutlets about the
desired shape; dip them into an <a href="#g_anglaise_3"><i>anglaise</i></a>, and roll them in
fine bread-crumbs. Definitely shape them; plunge them into
very hot fat; keep them therein till they have acquired a fine
golden colour; drain them, and dish them in a crown on a napkin,
with a heap of fried parsley in the middle.</p>

<p>Croquettes and cutlets may be garnished as fancy suggests,
but the accompaniment should always be served separately.
Tomato and Périgueux sauces are the most commonly
used, and the best garnishes for the purpose are all the purées,
peas, French beans, and <i>jardinières</i>.</p>

<p>For a fricassée cut up the chicken as for a <i><a href="#g_saute_2">sauté</a></i>, but divide
the legs into two. The procedure is exactly that of “Fricassée
de Veau” (No. <a href="#rcp.1276">1276</a>)—that is to say, the chicken is cooked in
the sauce.</p>

<p>About ten minutes before serving, add ten small onions,

 class="ns">[</span>528<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cooked in white consommé, and ten small grooved mushroom-heads.
Finish at the last moment with a pinch of chopped

<p>Cut some boiled or roast fowl into slices, and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> these
in a few drops of oil, lemon juice, and some chopped herbs for
one-quarter hour. Boiled fowl is preferable, in that the greater
porousness of its meat facilitates the percolation of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>
through it.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, dip the slices into very light
batter, and put them into very hot fat. Drain, the moment the
batter is well <i><a href="#g_gild">gilded</a></i>; dish on a napkin with fried parsley, and
serve a tomato sauce separately.</p>

<p>N.B.—Nowadays Fritôt and <a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a> of fowl are identically
the same dish, but formerly they differed in this, namely, that
the Fritôt was prepared from cooked fowl, and the <a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a>

<p>Pilaff, which is the national dish of Orientals, gives rise
to an endless number of recipes. The various curries of
veal, lamb, and fowl are “pilaffs,” and all except the one “à la

preparation—namely, that of curry; but for a change in the
condiments and the treatment of the rice, which is not the same
as that of “Riz à l’Indienne.”</p>

<p>Cut the fowl into small pieces, and fry it in mutton fat with

moisten with one pint of white consommé; add two-thirds of a
capsicum, cut into dice, and one and one-half oz. of currants

<p>Cut up the fowl as for a fricassée; season it; fry it in butter,
and add thereto three and one-half oz. of rice, browned in
butter, with one chopped onion, a leaf of bay, and two peeled
and <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i> tomatoes. Moisten with enough white broth
to more than cover, and cook in a very hot oven for twenty-five
minutes. At the end of this time the fowl and rice are cooked,
and the rice should be quite dry.</p>

<p>Sprinkle then with one-sixth pint of veal stock; mix the
latter with the pilaff by means of a fork, and dish with care in

<p>Poach the pullet; raise the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> and remove their skin;
slice them; coat them with white chaud-froid sauce, and decorate
them soberly with pieces of truffle. Trim the carcass;
coat it outside with white chaud-froid sauce, and fill it with a
fine crayfish <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>, reconstructing it exactly in so doing.</p>

<p>Cause a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> to set in a refrigerator; place the collops of

a dozen fine crayfish tails shelled and trimmed.</p>

<p>Coat the whole with half-melted aspic jelly; set in a deep
dish; incrust the latter in a block of ice, and pour enough very
good, melting aspic jelly (No. <a href="#rcp.159">159</a>) over the pullet to half-immerse
it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1688—Poularde au Champagne"><a id="rcp.1688"
 >1688—POULARDE AU CHAMPAGNE</a></h3>

<p>Stuff a pullet two days beforehand with a whole foie gras
studded with truffles and stiffened in butter for twenty minutes.
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poële</a></i> it in champagne; put it in a <i>cocotte</i>; cover it with its
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>-liquor, containing a sufficient addition of succulent
jelly, and leave it to cool.</p>

<p>On the morrow remove, by means of a spoon, the grease
that has settled on the jelly, and scald the latter twice or thrice
with boiling water, in order to remove the last traces of grease.</p>

<p>Serve this pullet very cold, in the same <i>cocotte</i> in which it
has cooled.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1689—Poularde en Chaud-froid"><a id="rcp.1689"
 >1689—POULARDE EN CHAUD-FROID</a></h3>

<p>Poach the pullet; let it cool in its cooking-liquor; cut it up,
and clear the pieces of all skin. Dip the pieces in chaud-froid
sauce, already prepared from the pullet’s cooking-liquor if
possible, and arrange them on a tray. Decorate each piece with
a fine slice of truffle; glaze with cold, melted jelly; leave to
set, and trim the edges of the pieces, just before dishing
them.</p>

<p><i>Old method of dishing</i>: Formerly, chaud-froids were dished
on a cushion of bread or rice, placed in the middle of a
border of jelly; and, between each piece, cocks’ combs and
mushrooms, covered with chaud-froid sauce or jelly, were set.</p>

<p>They were also dished on stearine tazzas, made in special
moulds; but these methods, however much they may have been
honoured by old cookery, are generally scouted at the present
day.</p>

<p>The method of dishing detailed hereafter is steadily ousting
them; it allows of serving much more delicate and more agreeable
chaud-froids in the simplest possible way, and was
inaugurated at my suggestion at the Savoy Hotel.</p>

<p><i>Modern method of dishing</i>: Set the decorated pieces, coated
with chaud-froid sauce, side by side on a layer of excellent aspic
jelly, lying on the bottom of a deep square dish. Cover them
with the same aspic, which should be half melted, and leave
to set. When about to serve, incrust the dish in a block of
carved ice, or surround it with the latter fragmented.</p>

<p><a id="png.551" href="#png.551"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>533<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This procedure allows of using less gelatinous products in
the preparation of the aspic, and the latter is therefore much
more delicate, mellow, and melting.</p>

<p>Having poached and cooled the pullets, raise the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>,
and cut each into three or four collops. Garnish these collops,
dome-fashion, with a <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> consisting of the meat cut from
the carcass, combined with an equal quantity of salted tongue
and truffle, and cohered with reduced chicken jelly.</p>

<p>Coat these collops with white chaud-froid sauce; sprinkle
them immediately with very red tongue, truffle, gherkins, and
hard-boiled white of egg; all chopped, mixed, and glazed with
jelly.</p>

<p>Now set the collops in a deep, square silver dish, alternating
them with oval slices of salted tongue.</p>

<p>Garnish their midst with a salad of French beans, cut
lozenge-form and cohered with aspic.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1691—Chaud-froid Felix Faure"><a id="rcp.1691"

<p>Raise the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> of a fine pullet; cut them in two in
the thick part, without separating them, and slightly flatten
them. Lay them on a piece of linen; season them; and, on one
of their halves, spread a layer of foie-gras purée thickened with
a little chicken forcemeat. Upon this layer set some rectangles
of raw foie gras, one-third in. thick; cover with purée, set some
slices of truffle upon the latter; coat again with purée; moisten
with white of egg, and over the whole press the other half of
the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprême</a></i>. Wrap each <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprême</a></i>, prepared in this way, in a
piece of muslin; poach them in a moderate oven, after having
moistened them to within half their height with chicken stock;
and leave them to cool in their cooking-liquor under slight
pressure.</p>

<p>This done, take off the muslin, and cut each <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprême</a></i> into
ten or twelve medallions. Envelop each medallion in a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>

breast, cut it into pieces one-third inch square, and put the
resulting trimmings aside.</p>

<p>Season these pieces and <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> them in a few drops of
brandy; prepare other pieces of the same size and length from
four oz. of truffles; six oz. of salted, fat pork; four oz.
of cooked ham, and four oz. of salted and cooked ox-tongue.
Then clear the meat of the legs of all tendons; add to it the
trimmings cut from the breast, as much very white veal and
twice as much very fat, fresh pork; season these meats with
salt, pepper and nutmeg; chop them up very finely; pound
them, and rub them through a sieve. Add the brandy in which
the fillets were <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>.</p>

<p>Spread a layer, three in. wide, of this forcemeat along the
whole of the middle of the chicken’s skin; upon this layer of
forcemeat set the strips of bacon, fowl, truffle, ham, and tongue,
arranging them alternately and regularly; upon them spread
another layer of forcemeat, equal to the first; then another layer
of the various pieces, and finally cover and envelop the whole
in what remains of the forcemeat.</p>

<p>Draw the skin of the fowl over the whole and completely
wrap the former round the latter. Carefully sew up the edges
of the skin, and roll the galantine in a napkin, either end of
which should be tightly strung.</p>

<p>With six lbs. of shin of veal, one-half lb. of fresh <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>
pork rind, and the fowl’s carcass, prepare a white veal stock
(No. <a href="#rcp.10">10</a>). When this stock has cooked for about five hours,
add the galantine to it, and gently cook the latter for about
one and one-quarter hours.</p>

<p>At the end of this time take the galantine off the fire; drain
it on a dish, and let it cool for ten minutes; remove the napkin
in which it has cooked, and roll it in another one which should
be similarly tied at both ends. This done, put the galantine to
cool under a weight not exceeding five or six lbs.</p>

<p>The cooking-liquor, once it has been cleared of grease and
clarified as for an aspic (No. <a href="#rcp.158">158</a>), constitutes a jelly which
accompanies the galantine. When the latter is quite cold,
remove the napkin covering it, trim it neatly at either end; coat
it with half-melted jelly, and dish it on a low cushion of carved
rice. Finally, decorate it as fancy may dictate with pieces of
jelly.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poële</a></i> a very tender chicken; do not colour it and have it
only just done. Withdraw it and leave it to cool. Add two
tablespoonfuls of strong veal stock and one tablespoonful of
burned brandy to the <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>-liquor.</p>

<p>Simmer for ten minutes. Strain this stock through a
sieve, and slightly press the vegetables in so doing, that all
their juices may be expressed.</p>

<p>Clear of grease, and reduce until the liquor does not measure
more than two tablespoonfuls. Put it on the side of the fire,
add the yolks of three eggs, stirring briskly the while, and add,
little by little, six oz. of very good, fresh butter, just as for a
Hollandaise sauce. Finally, add one and one-half leaves of
gelatine, dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and
rub the whole through tammy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, raise the chicken’s fillets and cut them into wide
and thin collops, after having cleared them of skin. Cover each
collop with a slice of truffle dipped in good, half-melted jelly,
and with them line the bottom and sides of a timbale-mould,
already <i><a href="#g_clothe">clothed</a></i> with jelly and incrusted in ice.</p>

<p>Then completely bone the chicken; finely pound the
remainder of its meat as well as the skin; rub the whole through
a fine sieve, and add the resulting purée to the prepared sauce.
Mix the whole well, and fill the mould with it. Allow to set
well, and turn out on a cushion of rice surrounded by fine
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of jelly.</p>

<p>N.B.—By substituting young ducks, young pigeons, or some
kind of game such as pheasant, woodcock, &amp;c., for the
chicken, this recipe may be applied to any piece of poultry or
game.</p>

collops with white chaud-froid sauce, and decorate them with
tarragon leaves, <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>, cooled, well-drained and very green.</p>

<p>Let a layer of aspic jelly one-half in. thick set on the bottom
of a timbale or a square dish; upon this layer set some slices
of foie-gras Parfait, cut to the shape of the collops, and place
one of the latter on each slice of the Parfait. This done, cover

<p>Line a raised-pie mould with patty paste (No. <a href="#rcp.2359">2359</a>), taking
care to leave a fine crest.</p>

<p>Bone a fowl weighing about four or five lbs. Set the
<i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> (each cut into three collops) to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> in a glass
<a id="png.560" href="#png.560"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>542<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of brandy, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and five medium-sized peeled
truffles, each cut into four or five thick slices.</p>

<p>With what remains of the fowl’s meat, as much lean pork
and veal (mixed in equal quantities) and twice as much fresh,
pork fat (<i>i.e.</i><!-- TN: italics added for consistency -->, a quantity equal in weight to all the other
meats put together), prepare a very smooth forcemeat; chopping
the whole first, then pounding it and rubbing it through a
sieve. Add to this forcemeat a little truffle essence; the
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> of the fillets; one raw egg, and the necessary seasoning,
to wit: salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Line the bottom and sides of the pie with this forcemeat;
on this first layer of forcemeat lay a thin slice of bacon and
thick slices of tongue, beef, or ham. Place thereon another
slice of bacon, followed by a thin layer of forcemeat, a layer
of truffle slices, another layer of forcemeat, the collops of fowl,
another layer of forcemeat, one more layer of truffles, one
more layer of forcemeat, one more layer of tongue or ham
(between two thin slices of bacon); and finally cover the whole
with what remains of the forcemeat and a slice of larding
bacon superposed by a bay-leaf. Now close the pie with a
cover of the same paste as that already used, carefully seal
down the cover to the crest of the underlying paste, trim and
pinch the crest, and deck this cover of paste with imitation-leaves
of the same paste.</p>

<p>Make a slit in the top of the pie, for the escape of steam;
carefully <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> the cover and the crest, and bake in a moderate
oven for about one and one-quarter hours. On withdrawing
the pie from the oven, let it half cool, and fill it with a
succulent, chicken jelly. Allow this dish to cool for at least
twenty-four hours before serving.</p>

<p>N.B.—With this recipe as model, and by substituting
another piece of poultry or game for the fowl, raised pies may
be prepared from every kind of game or poultry, except water-game,
which only yields mediocre results.</p>

<p>In the case of game pies, the forcemeat is combined with
one-sixth of its weight of <i>gratin</i> forcemeat (No. <a href="#rcp.202">202</a>) and an
equal quantity of fat bacon is suppressed. The chicken jelly
is also replaced by a jelly prepared from the carcasses of the
birds under treatment.</p>

<p>Young turkeys, served as relevés or entrées, admit of all
the recipes given for pullets; therefore, in order to avoid
unnecessary repetition, the reader is begged to refer to those
recipes.</p>

<p>Those most generally applied to young turkeys are the ones
termed “à l’Anglaise”—with celery, à la Financière, à la
Godard, and à la Jardinière.</p>

<p>In addition to these preparations, there are others which
are better suited and are more proper to young turkeys, and
these I give below.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1716—Dindonneau Farci aux Marrons"><a id="rcp.1716"
 >1716—DINDONNEAU FARCI AUX MARRONS</a></h3>

<p>Cut open the shells of two and one-quarter lbs. of chestnuts;
immerse them for a few seconds in smoking fat; peel
them, and almost completely cook them in consommé. Then
mix them with two lbs. of very finely-chopped pork, rubbed
through tammy. Fill the bird with this preparation; truss
it, and roast it on the spit or in the oven, basting frequently
the while.</p>

<p>Serve with the gravy separately. The latter should be
somewhat fat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1717—Dindonneau à la Catalane"><a id="rcp.1717"
 >1717—DINDONNEAU <span class="nw">A LA CATALANE</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut up the young turkey as for a fricassée, and fry the
pieces in three oz. of butter. When the pieces are nicely
browned, swill the utensil with one pint of white wine; season
with salt and pepper; add a piece, the size of a pea, of
crushed garlic, and completely reduce. Then moisten with
sufficient tomato purée and equal quantities of Espagnole and
brown stock to just cover the pieces.</p>

<p>Cook in the oven for forty minutes; transfer the pieces to
another dish after having trimmed them, and add one-half lb. of raw, quartered mushrooms, <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> in butter; twenty
chestnuts cooked in consommé; twenty small, glazed onions;
five quartered tomatoes, and ten sausages.</p>

<p>Strain the sauce over the pieces of turkey; complete the
cooking for twenty-five minutes, and dish in a timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1718—Dindonneau Chipolata"><a id="rcp.1718"
 >1718—DINDONNEAU CHIPOLATA</a></h3>

<p>This may be prepared in two ways, according as to whether
it be intended for lunch or for dinner.</p>

<p>(1) Cut up the young turkey and fry the pieces in butter
as above. Swill with one glassful of white wine; add a sufficient
quantity of <i><a href="#g_tomated">tomatéd</a></i> half-glaze sauce, just to cover the
pieces, and cook in the oven for forty minutes.</p>

<p><a id="png.562" href="#png.562"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>544<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This done, transfer the pieces to another stewpan and add
thereto twenty small, glazed onions, twenty chestnuts cooked
in consommé, ten <a href="#g_chipolata">chipolata</a> sausages, one-third lb. of frizzled
pieces of fresh pork cut into dice, and twenty olive-shaped and
glazed carrots. Strain the sauce over the whole, complete the
cooking and dish in a timbale.</p>

<p>(2) Braise the young turkey; glaze it at the last moment,
and set on a long dish. Surround it with the garnish given
above, combined with the reduced braising-liquor.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1719—Dindonneau en Daube"><a id="rcp.1719"
 >1719—DINDONNEAU EN DAUBE</a></h3>

<p>Bone the young turkey’s breast, and stuff it, arranging its
meat as for a galantine, with very good sausage-meat combined
with a glassful of liqueur brandy per two lbs. of the
former; bacon, truffles; and a very small and red ox-tongue,
covered with slices of bacon and set in the centre of the
garnish.</p>

<p>Reconstruct the young turkey; sew it; truss it, and put
it in a <i>terrine</i> just large enough to hold it and its moistening.</p>

<p>With the bones and the trimmings of the young turkey,
two slices of veal, two lbs. of frizzled beef, aromatics, one pint
of white wine, and two quarts of water, prepare a brown stock
after recipe <a href="#rcp.9">No. 9</a>. Reduce this stock to one and one-half
quarts; put it into the <i>terrine</i>; cover and thoroughly close up
the latter with a strip of paste, and cook in a hot oven for
two and one-half hours.</p>

<p>Leave to cool in the <i>terrine</i>, and, when about to serve,
slightly heat the latter in order to turn out the daube.</p>

 >1720—BLANC DE DINDONNEAU <span class="nw">A LA DAMPIERRE</span></a></h3>

<p>Remove and bone the young turkey’s legs. With the meat,
carefully cleared of all tendons, prepare a <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat;
spread the latter on a tray in a layer one-third in. thick, and
poach it. Stamp it out with an even, oval fancy-cutter, about
three in. by two in.</p>

<p>Braise or <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poële</a></i> the young turkey’s breast with the greatest
care, keeping it underdone. This done, raise the two <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>,
skin them, and cut them into collops of a size that will allow
of their being trimmed with the fancy-cutter already used.
With a little raw forcemeat, stick a collop to each oval of
poached forcemeat; then, by means of a piping-bag fitted
with an even pipe, garnish the borders of the collops with the
same forcemeat combined with twice its bulk of chopped salted
tongue. Set the medallions thus prepared on a covered tray,
and put them in the steamer that the forcemeat may poach.</p>

<p><a id="png.563" href="#png.563"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>545<span class="ns">]<br

fine rosette of a purée of peas in the centre of each medallion.
Set these medallions in a circle on a round dish, around a
little bowl of carved, fried bread, garnished with the same
purée of peas.</p>

<p>Serve separately a velouté prepared from the bones of the
dindonneau.</p>

<i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i>, skin them, and cut them into somewhat thick collops.</p>

<p>Dish these collops in a circle, and set a collop of foie gras,
<i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> in butter, between each.</p>

<p>Pour a Toulousaine garnish in their midst, and surround
with a thread of light glaze.</p>

 >1722—AILERONS DE DINDONNEAU DORÉS <span class="nw">A LA PURÉE DE MARRONS</span></a></h3>

<p>The pinions referred to in this recipe are pinions properly
so called; that is to say, they consist of the two last joints of
the wing. When they are properly prepared, they constitute
one of the most savoury luncheon entrées that can be served.</p>

<p>The pinions of large pullets may be treated in this way.</p>

<p>Clear and singe the pinions, and set them in a buttered
sautépan, just large enough to hold them. Colour gently on
both sides and drain.</p>

<p>In the same butter, gently brown a sliced carrot and onion,
to which add a few parsley stalks and a little thyme and bay.
Set the pinions on these aromatics; season moderately with salt
and pepper; cover the sautépan, and continue cooking gently
in a very slow oven, basting often the while.</p>

<p>The dish will be all the better for having been cooked slowly
and regularly. Do not moisten, if possible, or, at the most,
only do so with a few drops of water, in order to keep the
butter from clarifying—not an unusual occurrence when the
heat is too fierce.</p>

<p>When the pinions are cooked, dish them radially, and cover
them that they may keep warm. Add a few tablespoonfuls of
light stock or some water to the cooking butter, and set to
boil gently for fifteen minutes. When this stock is sufficiently
reduced to only half-immerse the pinions, pass it through a
fine strainer and clear of some of the grease if necessary;
remember, however, that this stock should be somewhat fat.</p>

<p>Pour it over the pinions, and serve a timbale of a fine purée
of marrons separately.</p>

<p>N.B.—Besides these various recipes, goslings may also be
prepared like young turkeys, <i>i.e.</i>, with chestnuts, à la <a href="#g_chipolata">Chipolata</a>,
en Daube; or with turnips, peas, and “en Salmis,”
like Duck.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1726—Foie Gras"><a id="rcp.1726"
 >1726—FOIE GRAS</a></h3>

<p>Foies gras are supplied either by geese or ducks. Goose’s
liver is larger, firmer and less readily melted than that of the
duck. As a rule the former should be selected in preference,
more particularly in the matter of hot dishes. Nevertheless,
failing goose’s liver, duck’s liver may be used and with very
good results when its quality is good.</p>

<p>Foies gras are used in the preparation of <i><a href="#g_terrine_1">terrines</a></i>, raised
pies, parfaits and <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>, which are among the most delicate
and richest of cold dishes.</p>

<p>They may also be used as a garnishing ingredient, in the
form of collops or <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> quenelles. Finally, they may
also be served as hot entrées.</p>

<p>When a whole foie gras is to be served hot, it must first be
trimmed, studded with raw truffles which have been previously
peeled, quartered, seasoned with salt and pepper, stiffened in
a glassful of brandy, together with a bay-leaf, and cooled
in a thoroughly closed <i>terrine</i>.</p>

<p>When the foie gras has been studded with truffles, wrap it
in thin slices of bacon or a piece of pig’s caul, and set it in
a thoroughly-sealed <i>terrine</i> before cooking it.</p>

<p>The best way to cook foie gras, when it is to be served
whole and hot, is to bake it in a crust of paste that can
absorb the excess of grease produced by the melting of the
liver. For this purpose prepare two layers of patty paste, a
little larger than the liver.</p>

<p>On one of these layers, set the liver wrapped in slices of
bacon; and, if possible, surround it with whole fair-sized
truffles, peeled. Set half a bay-leaf on the liver; moisten the
edges of the paste; cover the whole with the other layer of
paste; seal it down with the thumb, and fold over the edges
of the paste to form a regular, ornamented border which, besides
<a id="png.566" href="#png.566"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>548<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>finishing off the preparation, also increases the strength of the
welding.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i> the top; streak; make a slit in the top for the escape
of the steam; and, in the case of a medium-sized liver, cook in
a good, moderate oven for from forty to forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Serve this crust as it stands, and send the garnish separately.</p>

<p>In the dining-room, the waiter in charge removes the top
of the crust, cuts out the liver with a spoon, setting a piece
on each plate, and arranges around each piece the garnish
mentioned on the menu.</p>

<p>I am not partial to the cooking of foie gras in a <i>terrine</i>
when it is to be served hot. In any case the method described
above strikes me as being much the best, whatever be the
garnish that is served with the liver.</p>

<p>I particularly recommend a garnish of noodles, macaroni,
lazagnes, spaghetti and even rice, with hot foie gras.</p>

<p>These pastes should simply be cooked in water and finished
with cream.</p>

<p>This accompaniment makes the foie gras much more
digestible and palatable. The best garnishes for hot foie gras,
besides those given above, are truffles, whole or in slices,
or a Financière. In the matter of brown sauces, a Madeira
sauce suits admirably, provided it be of great delicacy and not
overcharged with Madeira; but a very light buttered, veal or
chicken glaze, combined with a little old Sherry or old Port,
is even superior. A Hongroise sauce with paprika or an excellent
suprême sauce may also be served when the garnish admits
of it.</p>

 >1727—FOIE GRAS CUIT DANS UNE BRIOCHE</a></h3>

<p>For this dish the foie gras is cooked differently; the result
is almost the same as that yielded by the crust prescribed
above, except that it is much more delicate. This method,
moreover, allows of obtaining a foie gras clear of all grease
(the latter being completely absorbed by the paste), and is
therefore best suited to cold dishing.</p>

<p>After having studded the foie gras with truffles and placed
it in a closed <i>terrine</i> as above, wrap it in slices of bacon, set it
to poach in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, and leave it to
cool.</p>

<p>Line a buttered timbale-mould, of a size in proportion to
that of the liver, with a thick layer of ordinary unsugared
brioche paste (No. <a href="#rcp.2370">2370</a>).</p>

<p>Put the foie gras upright in the mould, which it should
almost fill; close the timbale with a cover of the same paste;

band of strong, buttered paper, that the paste may be prevented
from running over, and let it rest for about thirty minutes in
a temperature of 86° F. to allow the paste to work.</p>

<p>Bake in a rather hot oven, until a needle inserted through
the centre withdraws quite clean.</p>

<p>Serve the dish as it stands with one of the ordinary foie-gras
garnishes.</p>

<p>Fresh foies gras do not bear transport very well, and, when
sent from a distance, often reach their destination tainted. It is,
therefore, difficult, whatever care may have been bestowed on
their preparation, to obtain the results which are achieved by
manufacturers who are renowned for this kind of produce. Consequently,
it is preferable to buy the Parfait of foie gras ready-made
from a good firm rather than to try to make it oneself.</p>

middle set a fresh foie gras, seasoned with salt, pepper, and
allspice; surround it with quails stuffed with a piece of truffle,
and set upright with their breasts against the slices of bacon.
Fill up the mould with whole, raw, and peeled truffles; cover

<h3 class="subhead" title="Ducks and Ducklings (Canards et Canetons)">Ducks and Ducklings (Canards et Canetons)</h3>

<p>Three varieties of the duck family are recognised in cookery,
viz., the Nantes duck, the Rouen duck, and the different kinds
of wild duck. The latter are generally used for roasts and in
salmis.</p>

<p>The Rouen duck is also served more often as a roast than
as an entrée. The characteristic trait of its preparation lies
in its being kept very underdone, and it is very rarely braised.
It is killed by suffocation, and not by bleeding, which is the
usual mode of killing other birds.</p>

<p>The Nantes duck, which is similar to the Aylesbury one, is
not so fleshy as the Rouen duck, and may be roasted, <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i>,

<p>This braised duckling must not be confused with roast duckling,

quite distinct.</p>

<p>As in the case of the roast, this duckling may be prepared
with Seville oranges; but, in this case, the sections of orange

the juice is used for the sauce.</p>

<p>Braise the duckling in one-third pint of brown stock and
two-thirds pint of Espagnole sauce, and cook it sufficiently to
allow of its being cut with a spoon.</p>

<p>Clear the sauce of grease; reduce it to a stiff consistence;
rub it through tammy, and add the juice of two oranges and
one half-lemon to it, which should bring the sauce back to its
original consistence.</p>

<p>Now add a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of the <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> yellow part only of the
rind of a half-orange and a half-lemon, but remember that the
addition of the juice and rind of the orange and the half-lemon
only takes place at the last moment, after which the sauce must
not boil again. Glaze the duckling, dish it, coat it slightly
with sauce, and surround it with sections of orange, skinned

 >1752—PÂTÉ<!-- TN: acute invisible --> CHAUD DE CANETON</a></h3>

<p>Roast the duckling, keeping it somewhat underdone, and
cut the whole of the breast into long collops or very thin slices.
Line a buttered Charlotte mould with short paste, and cover
the whole of the inside with a layer of <i>gratin</i> forcemeat
(No. <a href="#rcp.202">202</a>), combined with four tablespoonfuls of very reduced
half-glaze sauce per one and two-thirds lb. of forcemeat—the
necessary quantity for this pie.</p>

<p>On the layer of forcemeat arrange a litter of the slices of
breast; sliced, cooked mushrooms, and slices of truffle; and
fill the mould in this way, taking care to alternate the layers
of forcemeat, slices of breast, &amp;c. Complete with a coat of
forcemeat, upon which sprinkle a pinch of powdered thyme
and bay-leaf; close the mould with a thin layer of paste, sealed
down round the edges; make a slit in the top; <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i>, and bake
in a moderate oven for one hour.</p>

<p>When taking the pie out of the oven, turn it upside-down
on a dish; detach the base; cut the latter into triangles, and
set these triangles round the pie. Cover the forcemeat, thus
bared, with a few tablespoonfuls of Madeira sauce; set a large,
grooved, cooked mushroom just in the middle, and surround it
with a crown of sliced truffle.</p>

<p>Serve a Madeira sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1753—Ballotines de Caneton"><a id="rcp.1753"
 >1753—BALLOTINES DE CANETON</a></h3>

<p>Bone the duckling, and completely clear the bones of all
meat.</p>

<p>Remove all tendons from the latter, and chop it, together
with half its weight of veal, as much fresh pork fat, a third as
much panada (No. <a href="#rcp.190">190</a>), the yolks of four eggs, one-half oz. of
salt, and a little pepper and nutmeg. Pound; rub through a
sieve, and mix with this forcemeat, three oz. of <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> foie-gras
forcemeat and three oz. of chopped mushrooms, <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> in butter.
Divide up into portions weighing two oz.; wrap each portion
in a piece of the duckling’s skin; envelop in muslin, and poach
in a stock prepared from the duckling’s carcass. At the last
moment, remove the pieces of muslin and glaze the ballotines.</p>

<p>Dish in a circle, and set the selected garnish, which may be
turnips, peas, olives, or sauerkraut, &amp;c., in the middle.</p>

<p>Except for the one case when they are served cold “à

and always kept underdone. When they have to be stuffed,
the forcemeat is prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Fry four oz. of larding

one-half lb. of sliced ducks’ livers, a pinch of chopped parsley,
salt, pepper, and a little spice.</p>

<p>Keep the livers underdone, merely stiffened; let the whole
half-cool; pound, and rub through a fine sieve.</p>

<p>Add a few tablespoonfuls of veal gravy to the <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>-liquor;
set to boil for a few minutes; strain clear of grease, and finish
as directed under sauce Bigarrade claire (No.<!-- TN: period invisible --> 31).</p>

<p>Cover the slices of breast with some of the sauce, and serve
the remainder separately. “Aiguillettes” (or thin slices of
breast cut lengthwise) à l’orange are prepared in the same

bladder, and string the end of the latter close to the bird’s tail.
Wrap the bladder in a napkin, also strung, and poach gently

legs, which are not served; carve the fillets into fine slices, laid
one against the other on a lukewarm dish.</p>

<p>Chop up the carcass and press it, sprinkling it the while

<p>Stuff the duckling with the forcemeat given under No. <a href="#rcp.1754">1754</a>,
and roast it before a fierce fire for from twenty-five to thirty
minutes, according to its size.</p>

<p>Send a Rouennaise sauce to the table with it.</p>

<p>If it be served carved, remove the legs, <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> them inside,
season them well with salt and pepper, and grill them.</p>

<p>Cut the fillets into thin slices, set these on either side of a
long dish, and, in the middle, place the forcemeat withdrawn
from the inside.</p>

<p>Set the grilled legs at either end of the dish.</p>

<p>Roughly chop up the carcass and press it, sprinkling it

<p>After having suppressed the clavicle, truss the duckling.</p>

<p>Put it in a red oven, where it should only stay eight minutes,
<i>i.e.</i>, four minutes each side.</p>

<p>If possible, let it cool for a few minutes, that it may be more
easily carved. Take care, also, to wipe it, for, as a rule, the
fierceness of the oven blackens it. Remove the legs; <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i>
them inside; season and grill them.</p>

<p>Sprinkle a long, buttered dish with chopped shallots, kitchen
salt not too finely powdered, freshly-ground pepper, nutmeg,
and allspice.</p>

<p>Cut the fillets into very thin slices lengthwise, fifteen from
each fillet, and set them one against the other on the dish.
Sprinkle them with the same seasoning as that lying on the dish,
except for the shallots.</p>

<p>Remove the remaining stumps of the wings, as also the
small, remaining skin of the breast; season both, and set them
to grill by the side of the legs. Roughly chop up the carcass;
press it while sprinkling it with half a glassful of red wine,
and sprinkle the slices of breast with the collected gravy.</p>

<p>When about to serve, set a few small pieces of butter on
the slices of breast; heat for a moment on the stove, and put
the dish in a very hot oven, or at the salamander, that the
glazing may be instantaneous.</p>

<p>Withdraw the dish the moment the edges of the <a href="#g_aiguillettes"><i>aiguillettes</i></a>
begin to curl, set the grilled legs at either end of the dish, the
two wing-stumps, with the skin of the breast, in the middle, and

raw meat of another half-duckling, the white of an egg, and
three oz. of raw foie gras, prepare a <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat.</p>

<p>Fill the carcass with this forcemeat, shaping it so as to reconstruct
the bird. Surround it with a band of strong, buttered

<p>Surround it with emptied tangerines, filled with cold <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>

each fillet into eight thin slices; coat them with a brown chaud-froid
sauce, and decorate with truffles. Fill the carcass with
a <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> made from the remains of the meat, the duckling’s

<p>Glaze with aspic, and set in the refrigerator, that the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i>

<p>First prepare the following <span class="nw">forcemeat:—</span>Heat three oz. of
fat bacon, cut into small dice, and three oz. of butter in a
frying-pan. Throw six fine ducks’ livers (seasoned with salt
and pepper, and sprinkled with a pinch of powdered thyme,
bay-leaf, and half an onion chopped) into this fat. Toss them
over a fierce fire, just long enough to heat them; leave them
to cool, and rub them through a sieve.</p>

<p>Bone the breast of a Rouen duckling and its back as far
as the region of the legs, and suppress the tail. Stuff it with
the preparation given above; truss as for an entrée, and put

in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, in the oven, and under cover for forty
minutes.</p>

<p>With the carcass and some strong veal stock, prepare two-thirds
pint of excellent aspic, and, when withdrawing the

<p>Roast a Rouen duckling, and keep it underdone; let it cool,
and raise its fillets. With the carcass prepare a Salmis sauce,
and thicken it with aspic as for a chaud-froid sauce.</p>

<p>Cut the fillets into slices, coat them with Salmis sauce, and
leave this to set. Let a thickness of sauce set on the bottom of
a timbale.</p>

<p>Upon this sauce lay some of the coated slices, alternating
them with slices of truffle, and cover with a thin layer of aspic
jelly. Lay another row of slices of fillet and of truffles, followed
as before by a layer of aspic, and continue thus in the same
order. Complete with a somewhat thick layer of aspic, and
keep in the cool until ready for serving.</p>

<p>N.B.—This old and excellent cold entrée is really only a
cold salmis. The procedure may be applied to all game suited
to the salmis method of preparation. It is the simplest and
certainly the best way of serving them cold.</p>

<h3 title="GAME">GAME</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 title="Venison and Ground Game"><span class="allsc">VENISON AND GROUND GAME</span></h3>

<p>The stag (Fr. Cerf) and the fallow deer (Fr. Daim) supply
the only venison that is consumed in England, where the roebuck
(Fr. Chevreuil) is not held in very high esteem. True, the
latter’s flesh is very often mediocre in quality, and saddles and
legs of roebuck often have to be imported from the Continent
when they are to appear on an important menu.</p>

<p>On the other hand, venison derived from the stag or red deer
and the fallow deer proper is generally of superior quality. The
former has perhaps more flavour, but the latter, which is supplied
by animals bred in herds on large private estates, has no
equal as far as delicacy and tenderness are concerned, while it
is covered with white and scented fat, which is greatly appreciated
by English connoisseurs.</p>

<p>Although these two kinds of venison are generally served
as relevés, they belong more properly to the roasts, and I shall
give their recipes a little later on. In any case, only half of
the hind-quarters (that is to say, the leg together with that
part of the saddle which reaches from it to the floating ribs)
is served at high-class tables.</p>

<p>I shall now, therefore, only give the various recipes dealing
with roebuck, it being understood that these, if desired, may
be applied to corresponding joints of the stag or deer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1791—Selle de Chevreuil et Cuissot"><a id="png.586" href="#png.586"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>568<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.1791"
 >1791—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL ET CUISSOT</a></h3>

<p>Saddles and legs of roebuck may be prepared after the same
recipes, and allow of the same garnishes. The recipes for
saddle which I give hereafter may therefore be applied equally
well to legs.</p>

<p>Whichever joint be selected, it must first be cleared of all
tendons and then larded with larding bacon. The last operation
is no more essential than is the <i>marinading</i> which in
France has become customary with such pieces. It might even
be said with justice that <i>marinading</i> is not only useless, but
harmful, more particularly in the case of young animals whose
meat has been well hung.</p>

<p>Unlike many other specimens of game, roebuck has to be
eaten fresh; it does not suit it to be in the least tainted. I
should like to point out here that game shot in ambush is
best, owing to the fact that animals killed after a chase decompose
very quickly, and thereby lose a large proportion of their
flavour.</p>

<p>The saddle of the roebuck generally consists of the whole of
the latter’s back, from the withers to the tail, in which case
the bones of the ribs are cut very short, that the joint may lie
steady at all points.</p>

<p>At the croup-end, cut the joint on either side diagonally,
from the point of the haunch to the root of the tail. Sometimes,
however, the saddle only consists of the lumbar portion of the
back, and, in this case, the ribs are cut up to be cooked as
cutlets.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1792—Selle de Chevreuil à l’Allemande"><a id="rcp.1792"
 >1792—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL <span class="nw">A L’ALLEMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p><i>Marinade</i> the saddle for two or three days in raw <i>marinade</i>
No. <a href="#rcp.169">169</a>, and roast it, on a narrow baking-tray, upon the vegetables
of the <i>marinade</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the joint is cooked, withdraw it; swill the tray
with a little <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>, and almost entirely reduce. Clear of
grease; add two-thirds pint of cream and one powdered juniper
berry; reduce by a third; complete with a few drops of melted
glaze, and rub through tammy.</p>

<p>Serve this sauce at the same time as the saddle, which set
on a long dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1793—Selle de Chevreuil à la Baden-Baden"><a id="rcp.1793"
 >1793—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL <span class="nw">A LA BADEN-BADEN</span></a></h3>

<p>The saddle should be <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i> and well dried before being
set to cook.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_poele_1">Poële</a></i> it on the vegetables of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.</p>

<p>When it is cooked, put it on a long dish, and, at either end
<a id="png.587" href="#png.587"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>569<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of it, set a garnish of stewed pears, unsugared, but flavoured
with cinnamon and lemon-rind. Pour one-third pint of game
stock into the tray in which the joint was cooked; cook for ten
minutes; strain; clear of grease, and thicken with arrowroot.</p>

<p>Serve this thickened stock separately, and send some red-currant
jelly to the table at the same time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1794—Selle de Chevreuil aux Cerises"><a id="rcp.1794"
 >1794—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL AUX CERISES</a></h3>

<p>Keep the saddle for twelve hours in <i>marinade</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.169">169</a>)
made from verjuice instead of vinegar. Roast it on the spit,
basting it with the <i>marinade</i>, and keep it slightly underdone.</p>

<p>At the same time, serve a cherry sauce consisting of equal
quantities of poivrade sauce and red-currant jelly, to each pint
of which add three oz. of semi-candied cherries, set to soak in
hot water thirty minutes beforehand.</p>

<p>N.B.—This saddle need not be <i>marinaded</i> if it be desired
plain.</p>

 >1795—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL <span class="nw">A LA CUMBERLAND</span></a></h3>

<p>Roast it like a haunch of venison, without <i>marinading</i> it.
Send it to the table with a timbale of French beans, cohered
with butter, and serve a Cumberland sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.134">134</a>) separately.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a></i> it for a few hours only, and roast it on the spit,
basting it the while with the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.</p>

<p>Set it on a long dish, and surround it with bananas tossed
in butter.</p>

<p>At the same time serve a Roberts sauce, combined with a

<p>Lard and roast it. Set it on a long dish, and surround it
with artichoke-bottoms, garnished with lentil purée, and alternated
with chestnuts cooked in a small quantity of consommé

<p>Serve a venison sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1798—Selle de Chevreuil au Genièvre"><a id="rcp.1798"
 >1798—SELLE DE CHEVREUIL AU GENIÈVRE</a></h3>

<p>Lard the saddle, and roast it. Swill the baking-tray with
a small glassful of burned gin; add one powdered juniper berry
and one-sixth pint of double cream. Reduce the cream to half;
complete with a few tablespoonfuls of poivrade sauce and a few
drops of lemon juice. Serve this sauce with the saddle, and
send separately some hot stewed apples, very slightly
sugared.</p>

<p>Saddle of roebuck may also be served with the following

<h3 class="recipe" title="1800—Noisettes et Côtelettes de Chevreuil"><a id="rcp.1800"
 >1800—NOISETTES ET CÔTELETTES DE CHEVREUIL</a></h3>

<p>The same recipes may be applied to both. Trim them after
the manner of lamb noisettes or cutlets. They may be moderately
<i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>, but they may also be used fresh. In the
latter case, fry them in butter over a somewhat fierce fire, like
the lamb noisettes.</p>

<p>If they have been <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>, it is better to toss them very
quickly in very hot oil, and then to dry them before dishing
them.</p>

<p>It is in the dishing only that the noisettes and the cutlets
differ; for, whereas the latter are always dished in a crown,
one overlapping the other, or each separated from the rest by
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumb fried in butter, the noisettes are always
dished in a circle on small, oval <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> fried in butter, or on
tartlet crusts containing some kind of garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1801—Côtelettes de Chevreuil Conti"><a id="rcp.1801"

<p><i><a href="#g_saute_1">Sauté</a></i> the cutlets in very hot oil; dry them; dish them
in a crown, and separate them by similarly-shaped collops
of salted tongue.</p>

<p>Swill the saucepan with a little white wine; add this liquor
to a Poivrade sauce, and coat the cutlets with it.</p>

<p>Serve a light, buttered purée of lentils at the same time.</p>

<p>Spread an even layer, one-third inch thick, of <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i>
game forcemeat on a tray. Poach this forcemeat in a steamer
or in a very moderate oven, and cut it into triangles equal in
size to the cutlets.</p>

<p>Toss the latter as already explained; dish them in a crown,
and separate them by <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of forcemeat already prepared.</p>

<p>Coat the whole with poivrade sauce, thinned by means of
a little beaten cream, and garnished with crescents of truffle
and hard-boiled white of egg, and serve a purée of chestnuts
at the same time.</p>

<p>Carefully clear the meat of the roebuck of all tendons, and
chop it up with a knife, combining with it the while the third
of its weight of fresh butter, as much bread-crumb, soaked in
milk, and pressed, and one-third pint of fresh cream per lb. of
meat. Season, divide into portions weighing two oz., mould
to a nice round shape, wrap in pig’s caul, cook quickly at the
last moment, and dish in the form of a crown.</p>

<p>Coat with Chasseur sauce, and send a timbale of celery
purée separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1807—Noisettes de Chevreuil Walkyrie"><a id="rcp.1807"
 >1807—NOISETTES DE CHEVREUIL WALKYRIE</a></h3>

<p><i><a href="#g_saute_1">Sauté</a></i> the noisettes in the usual way, and dish them in the
form of a crown, each on a small quoit of “Pommes Berny”
(No. <a href="#rcp.2184">2184</a>). On each noisette lay a fine, grilled mushroom,
garnished with a rosette of Soubise purée, made by means of
a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe. Pour a little venison
sauce over the dish, and send a sauceboat of it separately.</p>

<p>N.B.—Roebuck noisettes and cutlets are still served with
purées of chestnuts or celery, with truffles, <i><a href="#g_cepes">cèpes</a></i>, mushrooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The sauces best suited to them are Poivrade sauce and its
derivatives, such as Venison sauce, Grand-Veneur sauce,
Romaine sauce, &amp;c., also Roberts sauce Escoffier.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1808—Civet de Chevreuil"><a id="rcp.1808"
 >1808—CIVET DE CHEVREUIL</a></h3>

<p>For “Civet de Chevreuil” the shoulders, the neck, and the
breast are used, and these pieces are cut up and set to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>
six hours beforehand with the aromatics and the same red wine
as that with which the civet will be moistened.</p>

<p><a id="png.590" href="#png.590"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>572<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>When about to prepare the civet, drain and dry these pieces,
and proceed exactly as for “Civet de Lièvre” (No. <a href="#rcp.1821">1821</a>),
except for the thickening by means of blood, which the difficulty
of obtaining the blood of the roebuck perforce precludes.</p>

<p>This civet, which should be classed among dishes for the
home, is usually served in the form of a stew; for, inasmuch
as the final thickening with blood is lacking, it can only be
an imitation of the civet. When, therefore, hare’s blood is
available, it should always be used in finishing this dish exactly
after the manner of No. <a href="#rcp.1821">1821</a>—that is to say, the preparation
should be given the characteristic stamp of civet by means of
a final thickening with blood.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1809—Boar and Young Boar (Sanglier et Marcassin)"><a id="rcp.1809"
 >1809—BOAR AND YOUNG BOAR (SANGLIER ET MARCASSIN)</a></h3>

<p>When the wild boar is over two years of age, it is no more
fit to be served as food. Between one and two years it should
be used with caution, and the various roebuck recipes may
then be applied to it. But only the young boar less than twelve
months old should be prepared in decent kitchens.</p>

<p>The hams of a young boar, salted and smoked, supply a
very passable relevé, which allows of varying the ordinary
menu. They are treated exactly like pork hams.</p>

<p>The saddle and the cushions may be prepared after the
recipes given for saddle of roebuck, and the same holds good
with the cutlets and the noisettes.</p>

<p>Finally, the saddle may be served cold, in a daube, when it
is prepared after No. <a href="#rcp.1173">1173</a>.</p>

<p>As the various parts of the young boar are covered with
fat, it is understood that they are not larded, nor do they
need it.</p>

 >1810—HARE AND LEVERET (LIÈVRE ET LEVRAUT)</a></h3>

<p>As a result of one of those freaks of taste, of which I have
already pointed out some few examples, hare is not nearly so
highly esteemed as it deserves in England; and the fact seems
all the more strange when one remembers that in many of her
counties excellent specimens of the species are to be found.</p>

<p>Whatever be the purpose for which it is required, always
select a young hare, five or six lbs. in weight. The age may
be ascertained as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Grasp one ear close to its extremity
with both hands, and pull in opposite directions; if the ear
tear, the beast is young; if it resist the strain, the hare is
old, and should be set aside for soups and the preparation of
<i><a href="#g_fumet">fumets</a></i> and forcemeats.</p>

 >1811—LIÈVRE FARCI <span class="nw">A LA PERIGOURDINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Take care to collect all the blood when emptying the hare;
break the bones of the legs, that they may be easily trussed;
clear the legs and the fillets of all tendons, and lard them.
Chop up the liver, the lungs, the heart, and four fowls’ livers,
together with five oz. of fat bacon.</p>

<p>Add to this mincemeat five oz. of soaked and pressed bread-crumbs,
the blood, two oz. of chopped onion, cooked in butter
and cold; a pinch of chopped parsley, a piece of crushed garlic
the size of a pea, and three oz. of raw truffle parings. Mix
the whole up well; fill the hare with this stuffing; sew up the
skin of the belly; truss the animal, and braise it in white wine
for about two and one-half hours, basting it often the while.
Glaze at the last moment. Serve the hare on a long dish.</p>

<p>Add two-thirds pint of half-glaze game sauce to the braising-liquor;
reduce; clear of grease; strain, and add three oz. of
chopped truffles to this sauce.</p>

<p>Pour a little sauce over the dish on which the hare has been
set, and serve what remains of the sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1812—Râble de Lièvre"><a id="rcp.1812"
 >1812—RÂBLE DE LIÈVRE</a></h3>

<p>The French term “râble” means the whole of the back of
the hare, from the root of the neck to the tail, with the ribs
cut very short.</p>

<p>Often, however, that piece which corresponds with the
saddle in butchers’ meat alone is taken, <i>i.e.</i>, the piece reaching
from the croup to the floating ribs. Whatever be the particular
cut, the piece should be well cleared of all tendons, and finely
larded before being set to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>; and this last operation may
even be dispensed with when the “<a href="#g_rable">râble</a>” is derived from a
young hare.</p>

<p><i>Marinading</i> would only become necessary if the piece had
to be kept some considerable time.</p>

<p>Set the <a href="#g_rable"><i>râble</i></a> well dried on the vegetables of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>,
which should be laid on the bottom of a long, narrow dish.
When it is nearly cooked, remove the vegetables, pour one-quarter

<h3 class="recipe" title="1821—Civet de Lièvre"><a id="rcp.1821"
 >1821—CIVET DE LIÈVRE</a></h3>

<p>Skin and clean the hare, taking care to collect all the blood
in so doing. Put the liver aside, after having carefully freed
it from the gall-bladder, as also from those portions touching
the latter.</p>

<p>Cut up the hare, and put the pieces in a basin with a few
tablespoonfuls of brandy and an equal quantity of olive oil,
salt, pepper, and an onion cut into thin roundels. Cover and
leave to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for a few hours in the very red wine used
for the moistening. Fry one-half lb. of lean bacon, cut into
large dice, in butter, and drain it as soon as it is brown. In
the same butter brown two fair-sized, quartered onions; add
two tablespoonfuls of flour, and cook this roux gently until
it acquires a golden tinge. Put the pieces of hare into this
roux, after having well dried them, and stiffen them.</p>

<p>Moisten with the wine used for the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>. Add a large
faggot, in which place a garlic clove; cover, and leave to cook
gently on the side of the stove.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, thicken the civet with the
reserved blood, which should be gradually heated, and mix
therewith a few tablespoonfuls of sauce. Then transfer the
pieces of hare, one by one, to another saucepan with the fried
pieces of bacon, twenty small, glazed onions, and twenty cooked
mushrooms.</p>

<p>Strain the sauce over the whole through a strainer.</p>

<p>Take a fresh hare, and bone it from the back without emptying
it, that the skin of the belly may be untouched.</p>

<p>Detach the shoulders and the legs; do not touch the head;
<a id="png.595" href="#png.595"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>577<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with a few drops of
brandy, and leave to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>. With the hare’s liver, some
fat bacon, and some truffle parings, prepare a <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> forcemeat.
Prepare another forcemeat with the meat of the shoulders
and the legs, an equal weight of fat bacon, one egg, a pinch of
wild thyme, salt, pepper, spices, and the brandy of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>.
Rub this forcemeat through a sieve, and add to it the
<i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> forcemeat, one-half lb. of fat bacon, and five oz. of
truffles cut into dice.</p>

<p>Fill the boned hare with this preparation; sew it up, and
tie the head to the back in such wise as to give the piece the
appearance of the animal at rest.</p>

<p>Wrap it in slices of bacon, and set it in a <i>terrine</i> lined with
the latter; sprinkle with a glassful of brandy, and place in
the oven for thirty minutes with lid off.</p>

<p>Then pour into the <i>terrine</i> a <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> prepared with red wine
from the hare’s bones; cover, and then cook in the oven gently
for three hours.</p>

<p>Leave to half-cool; drain away the cooking-liquor, and
carefully remove the slices of bacon. Strain the cooking-liquor
through muslin; return it to the <i>terrine</i>, and fill up the latter
with savoury jelly.</p>

<p>Keep in the cool for two hours before serving.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1824—Pâté de Lièvre"><a id="rcp.1824"

<p>Clear the fillets, the minion fillets, and the legs of all
tendons; moderately lard them; season them; set them in a
dish with an equal quantity of truffles and fat bacon strips;
sprinkle with some brandy, and leave to <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i> for one
hour. With what remains of the meat, some fillets of veal
and pork, in the proportion of six oz. per lb. of hare; fresh,
fat bacon in the proportion of one and one-half lbs. per lb. of
hare; and spiced salt, prepare a forcemeat, and finish it with
one egg and three tablespoonfuls of brandy per lb. of forcemeat.</p>

<p>Rub through tammy, and add a portion of the hare’s blood.</p>

<p>Line a round or oval buttered mould with raised-pie paste,
and completely cover the paste with slices of bacon. Then coat
inside with forcemeat, and fill up the mould with alternate layers
of forcemeat, hares’ fillets, truffle, and fat bacon strips.</p>

<p><a id="png.596" href="#png.596"><span class="pagenum"><span

made from paste.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i>; bake in a moderate oven, and, when the pie is almost
cold, pour some jelly flavoured with hare <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> into it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1825—Terrine de Lièvre"><a id="rcp.1825"
 >1825—TERRINE DE LIÈVRE</a></h3>

<p>A “<a href="#g_terrine_1">Terrine</a>” or Patty is only a pie without a crust, and it
allows of the same forcemeat and of the same garnish of bacon
strips as the latter. The <i>terrine</i> should first be lined with
slices of bacon, whereupon it is garnished like the pie with
alternate layers of forcemeat, bacon strips, hares’ fillets, and
truffles.</p>

<p>Cover with a slice of bacon; sprinkle the centre of the
latter with a little powdered thyme and bay, and a little spice.
Put the lid on the <i>terrine</i>, place it in a saucepan containing a
little water, and set it to cook in the oven.</p>

<p>The time allowed for cooking is naturally subject to the
size of the <i>terrine</i>. It is known to be quite cooked when the
grease which rises to the surface is quite clear.</p>

<p>As long as this grease is turbid, raw juices are still issuing
from the forcemeat and the garnish inside. Another method
of telling is by the insertion of a needle. If the latter withdraws
evenly heated throughout its length, the <i>terrine</i> is cooked.</p>

<p>If the patty is to be served immediately, add some aspic to
it when it is just tepid, and set it to cool under slight pressure.
When quite cold, clear it of grease; trim its surface, and cut
it up in the utensil.</p>

<p>If it is to be served whole and presented, set it to cool under
greater pressure; turn it out, and trim it all round. This done,
cause a layer of jelly to set on the bottom of the <i>terrine</i>; return
the trimmed patty to the latter, and surround it with melted
aspic jelly.</p>

<p>When about to serve, turn it out after the manner of an
aspic; set it on a long dish, and border the latter with jelly
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i>.</p>

<p>If it have to be kept some time, proceed as above, but use
lard instead of aspic, and keep it well covered and in the cool.</p>

found in the region of the patella.</p>

<p>As the wild rabbit ages, this bone shrinks and finally combines
with the other bones of the articulation.</p>

<p>Feathered game comprises all esculent birds that live in
freedom.</p>

<p>The number of species involved, therefore, is considerable,
but from the culinary standpoint they may be grouped into
ten principal classes, which <span class="nw">are:—</span></p>

<ul class="ol"><!-- TN: original just uses ordinary paragraphs -->
<li><span class="rcp">1.</span> The various pheasants, grey and red partridges, the Tetras Californias.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">2.</span> The hazel-hen, grouse, prairie fowls, ganga, sand-grouse.<!-- TN: original has comma --></li>

<li><span class="rcp">3.</span> The various wild ducks and teals.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">4.</span> The woodcocks and snipes.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">5.</span> The various plovers, lapwings, sandpipers, water-rails, water-hens.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">6.</span> The quails, land-rails, Virginia quails.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">7.</span> The various thrushes, Corsican blackbirds.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">8.</span> The various larks.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">9.</span> The warblers.</li>

<li><span class="rcp">10.</span> The ortolans.</li>
</ul>

<p>The birds of Classes 1 and 4 are better high—that is to
say, they should be hung for a few days, before being plucked,
in a moderate draught, that they may begin to decompose, and
that the particular flavour of their flesh may be accentuated, a
process which increases their culinary value. Whatever
opinion may be held in regard to the gaminess of these birds,
one thing is quite certain—namely, that the meat of a fresh
pheasant and that of a high one are two totally different things.
When fresh, the meat is flavourless, whereas when it is reasonably
high it is tender, full of taste, and of an incomparable
flavour.</p>

<p>Formerly, it was the custom to lard the birds of Class 1,
especially when they were to be roasted. But this practice
should be resolutely discarded, for, if the bird be young, it
can only impair the latter’s flavour, and, if it be old, it cannot
possibly restore those qualities to it which it has already lost.</p>

<p><a id="png.598" href="#png.598"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>580<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Besides, an old bird should never be served; it ought only
to be used in the preparation of game stock or forcemeats.</p>

<p>The birds belonging to the remaining classes are prepared
fresh; or, if it be thought necessary to let them hang for a
few days, at least they should not be allowed to get high, more
particularly the aquatic ones, because gaminess is, if anything,
deleterious to the flavour of their flesh.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1828—Pheasant (Faisan)"><a id="rcp.1828"
 >1828—PHEASANT (FAISAN)</a></h3>

<p>When this bird is young, its legs are grey and the ventral
end of the sternum is tender and flexible. But with pheasants,
as with partridges, an infallible sign of youth may be discovered
at the extremity of the last large feather in the wing. If this
feather be pointed, the bird is young; if it be round, the reverse
is the case.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1829—Faisan à la Mode d’Alcantara"><a id="rcp.1829"
 >1829—FAISAN <span class="nw">A LA MODE</span> D’ALCANTARA</a></h3>

<p>This recipe comes from the famous Alcantara convent. History
tells us that at the beginning of the Portuguese campaign
in 1807 the convent’s library was pillaged by Junot’s soldiers,
and its precious manuscripts were used in the making of cartridges.</p>

<p>Now it happened that an officer of the commissariat who
was witnessing the event found, among a collection of recipes
selected by the monks, the particular one now under our notice,
which was applied only to partridges.</p>

<p>It struck him as interesting, and after trying it when he returned
to France in the following year, he surrendered it to
the Duchess of Abrantès, who noted it in her memoirs.</p>

<p>It represents, perhaps, the only good thing the French
derived from that unfortunate campaign, and it would tend to
prove that foie gras and truffles, which had been known for
so long in Languedoc and Gascony, were also known in Estremadura,
where, even at the present day, tolerably good truffles
are to be found.</p>

<p>The procedure is as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Empty the pheasant from the front; bone its breast, and stuff
it with fine ducks’ foies gras, mixed with quartered truffles,
cooked in port wine.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_marinade">Marinade</a></i> the pheasant for three days in port wine, taking
care that it be well covered therewith. This done, cook it “<i><a href="#g_casserole">en
casserole</a></i>” (the original recipe says on the spit, but the saucepan
is more suitable). Reduce the port wine of the <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinade</a></i>;
add to it a dozen medium-sized truffles; set the pheasant on
these truffles, and heat for a further ten minutes.</p>

<p><a id="png.599" href="#png.599"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>581<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>N.B.—This last part of the recipe may be advantageously
replaced by the “à la Souvaroff” treatment—that is to say,
having placed the pheasant and the truffles in a <i>terrine</i>, sprinkle
them with the reduced port combined with slightly buttered
game glaze; then hermetically seal down the lid of the <i>terrine</i>,
and complete the cooking in the oven.</p>

 >1830—FAISAN <span class="nw">A L’ANGOUMOISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Stuff the pheasant with a preparation consisting of two-thirds lb. of very fresh pork fat, rubbed through a sieve; four oz. of raw, peeled, and quartered truffles, and four oz. of fine
chestnuts, cooked in consommé.</p>

<p>This preparation, which should be seasoned as for the
ordinary truffling (No. <a href="#rcp.1956">1956</a>), ought to be quite cold when
inserted into the pheasant.</p>

<p>Wrap the bird in slices of bacon; roast it gently for three-quarters
of an hour, and take care to remove the slices of bacon
seven or eight minutes before the cooking is completed, that
the outside of the piece may be coloured.</p>

<p>Set on a long dish, and serve a Périgueux sauce at the same
time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1831—Faisan à la Bohémienne"><a id="rcp.1831"

<p>Season a small foie gras with salt and paprika; stud it with
raw quartered truffles, and poach it in Madeira for twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>When it is cold, insert it into the pheasant, which should
be high. Truss the bird, and cook it in butter in a saucepan
or a <i>cocotte</i> for forty-five minutes. When about to serve,
remove some of the butter used in cooking; sprinkle the
pheasant with a glassful of burnt brandy, and add a few tablespoonfuls

<p>Bone two woodcocks, and put their livers and intestines
aside.</p>

<p>Chop up their meat, together with a quarter of its weight
of poached and cooled beef-marrow, and as much fresh, fat
bacon; salt, pepper, and herbs. Add to this hash six oz. of
raw, peeled, and quartered truffles, slightly cooked in butter.</p>

<p>Stuff the pheasant with this preparation; truss it; wrap it
in slices of bacon, and keep it in the cool for twenty-four hours,
that the aroma of the truffles may be concentrated.</p>

<p>Roast the pheasant on the spit, or, if in the oven, set it on
a somewhat high stand in a baking-pan. Cut a large <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûton</a></i>

<p>Pound the woodcocks’ livers and intestines with an equal
weight of grated fresh fat bacon, the well-washed fillets of

When this forcemeat is very smooth and all its ingredients
thoroughly mixed, spread it over the fried <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i>.</p>

 >1846—SUPRÊMES, CÔTELETTES ET FILETS DE FAISAN</a></h3>

<p>Pheasant <a href="#g_supreme">Suprêmes</a>, Cutlets and Fillets, allow of the same
garnishes as those of fowl. But, whereas in the case of the
latter, they are raised raw, and then poached, my advice in
regard to pheasant is, that it should be previously roasted or
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëled</a></i> (keeping it just underdone) and that the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> be
only raised at the last moment.</p>

<p>By this means, a much better result is obtained than by
the poaching of raw fillets; which, once cooked, are generally
dry if they have to wait but a few seconds.</p>

<p>I also advise, when the garnish consists only of foie-gras
collops and truffles (as in the case of the <i>Rossini</i> garnish), the
sending separately of a small timbale of noodles with cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1847—Salmis de Faisan"><a id="rcp.1847"
 >1847—SALMIS DE FAISAN</a></h3>

<p>Salmis is perhaps the most delicate and most perfect of
the game preparations bequeathed to us by old-fashioned
cookery. If it be less highly esteemed nowadays, it is owing
to the fact that this recipe has been literally spoiled by the
haphazard fashion in which it has been applied right and left
to game already cooked, and cooked again for the purpose.</p>

<p>But the Salmis given above may always be included in any
menu, however sumptuous. It is applied more particularly to
game of the 1st and 2nd classes, which should be somewhat
high when treated.</p>

<p>The recipe I give may be applied to all the birds in the two
classes referred to.</p>

<p>Roast the pheasant, keeping it moderately underdone.
Quickly cut it into eight pieces, thus: two legs, two wings
(separated from the pinions), and the breast cut into four lengthwise.
<a id="png.604" href="#png.604"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>586<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Skin the pieces; trim them neatly, and keep them at a
temperate heat in a covered vegetable-pan, with a few drops of
burnt brandy and a little clear melted meat glaze.</p>

<p>Pound the carcass and the trimmings, and add to them half
a bottleful of red wine (almost entirely reduced), three chopped
shallots and a few mignonette pepper. Add one-quarter pint
of good game Espagnole sauce; cook for ten minutes; rub
through a sieve, pressing well the while, and then strain through
a strainer.</p>

<p>Reduce this sauce to about one-third, and despumate it;
strain it once more through a close strainer; add a small quantity
of butter, and pour it over the pieces of pheasant, to which
add a fine, sliced truffle and six grooved mushroom-heads.</p>

<p>I advise the discarding of the old method of dishing upon
a cushion of bread fried in butter, as also of the triangular
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> fried in butter and coated with <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> forcemeat, which
usually accompanied the Salmis.</p>

<p>A speedy preparation and a simple method of dishing, which
facilitate the service and allow of the Salmis being eaten hot,
are the only necessary conditions. Moreover, the goodness of
the preparation is such as to be independent of a fantastic
method of dishing.</p>

<p>Unless it be prepared with the greatest care, <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> pheasant
is always dry. I therefore do not recommend it; but, should
it be necessary to make a dish of it, care should be observed in
selecting a young, plump bird. It should be cut up like a
fowl, cooked in butter on a moderate fire and kept somewhat
underdone.</p>

<p>Dish it after the manner of a “poulet <a href="#g_saute_2">sauté</a>” and cover it.
Swill the sautépan and prepare a sauce after the recipe in
common use.</p>

<p>This sauce must always be short, and it should be poured
over the pheasant just before serving it.</p>

it with salt, pepper and melted butter, and gently grill.</p>

<p>At the same time grill six small mushroom-heads.</p>

<p>Dish the partridge; on either side of it set the mushrooms,
each of which should be garnished with a coffeespoonful of

<p>Prepare a garnish of braised cabbages as explained under No. <a href="#rcp.2100">2100</a>, and add thereto an old partridge, browned in the oven
or on the spit. Meanwhile, roast or <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poële</a></i> a very tender young

<p>Dish the cabbages, which should be well drained; set the
young partridge upon them, and surround with small rectangles
of very lean bacon, cooked with the cabbages, and a thread of
half-glaze sauce, flavoured with game <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>

<p>N.B.—This dish may be given a more decorative appearance
by means of a sort of <i>Chartreuse</i>, which is prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>Line
a large bowl or a buttered, round-bottomed timbale
with roundels of sausages; roundels of carrots arranged in
superposed rows, separated by a line of French beans or peas;
and small rectangles of bacon, laid side by side.</p>

<p>Line the inside of the timbale with a thick layer of cabbages,
and put the young partridge, breast undermost, in the
middle (the partridge may also be carved up). Cover the cabbages
and press the latter with a fork; turn the timbale out on a
dish and tilt the latter that all the grease may fall before withdrawing
the timbale, which answers the purpose of a mould.</p>

<p>Surround with a thread of half-glaze sauce, flavoured with

other particulars) under “Crépinettes de ris de Veau” (No. <a href="#rcp.1222">1222</a>), taking care to add three oz. of chopped truffles per lb.
of the forcemeat.</p>

<p>Divide up the forcemeat into portions one and one-half oz.
to two oz. in weight; wrap them in pig’s caul; roll them first
in melted butter and then in bread-crumbs, and grill them
gently.</p>

<p>The usual accompaniment to these <a href="#g_crepinettes">crépinettes</a> is a light

 >1874—WOODCOCK AND SNIPE (BÉCASSE ET BÉCASSINES<!-- TN: acute invisible -->)</a></h3>

<p>If grouse, which can only be thoroughly appreciated in
its native country, were extinct, woodcock would be the leading
feathered game. But the latter have this advantage over the
former, namely: that their <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i> is not so fugitive, and that
they may be kept much longer. Woodcock does not yield its
full quality unless it be moderately high.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1875—Bécasse de Carême"><a id="png.611" href="#png.611"><span class="pagenum"><span

 >1875—BÉCASSE DE CARÊME</a></h3>

<p>Sprinkle the woodcock with a few drops of oil, and roast
it, keeping it underdone. As soon as it is cooked, divide it
into two lengthwise, and cut each half of the breast into two
collops. Mix half a coffeespoonful of French mustard in a
small vegetable-pan, with a few drops of lemon juice. Roll the
pieces of woodcock in this mustard, and keep them hot.</p>

<p>Chop up the carcass and the intestines; sprinkle with a
glassful of burnt liqueur brandy; reduce; add a tablespoonful
of game <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, and cook for five minutes.</p>

<p>Strain through a strainer, pressing on the pieces of woodcock
in so doing, and rock the saucepan, that the pieces may
be coated with the cullis. Dish in a hot timbale, and, upon
the pieces, set the woodcock’s head.</p>

<p>N.B.—<i>Bécasse à la fine Champagne</i> is prepared in the same
way, but without mustard. Cut it into six pieces: wings, legs
and two halves of the breast, and put these pieces into a round
<i>cocotte</i>. Swill the saucepan with burnt liqueur brandy; add the
chopped intestines, mixed with the juices of the pressed carcass;
add a tablespoonful of <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>, a little lemon juice, and a little
cayenne, and pour this cullis (heated but not boiled) over the
pieces.</p>

<p><i>Bécasse à la Riche</i> is prepared in the same way, <span class="nw">but:—</span>(1) the pieces are dished on a <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûton</a></i> of fried bread, coated with
<i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> forcemeat of game; (2) the sauce is thickened with a
little foie-gras purée and one oz. of butter, and then strained
over the pieces through a coarse strainer, during which process
the operator should press with a spoon or a whisk.</p>

<p>When the carcass is garnished, set the sliced <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> on
the forcemeat, with a row of sliced truffles in the middle. The
forcemeat should poach for about twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Under the article “Pheasant,” I gave the generic recipe for

<p>Roast the woodcocks and keep them underdone.</p>

<p>Raise the <i><a href="#g_supreme">suprêmes</a></i> and put them in the timbale, separating
them by collops of fresh foie gras, <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> at the last moment.</p>

<p>Pound the remains of the woodcocks, including their carcasses;
thin the purée with truffle essence; rub it through a

cook for a few minutes; strain, and in this stock poach five oz.
of olive-shaped truffles (for an ordinary timbale).</p>

<p>Line a buttered Charlotte-mould with short paste; cover its

<p>Quails should always be chosen plump, and their fat should

be used in preference to the oven for roasting, they allow of
two other methods of cooking: they may be cooked in butter,
in a saucepan; or they may be poached in excellent strong and
gelatinous veal stock.</p>

<p>Moisten, just enough to cover, with some succulent amber-coloured
veal stock, gelatinous and fine; cover, boil, and then
poach gently for twelve minutes.</p>

<p>This done, add a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of truffles (raw if possible) which
should equal only half of the vegetable <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i>, and poach for

quail <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1900—Timbale de Cailles Alexandra"><a id="rcp.1900"
 >1900—TIMBALE DE CAILLES ALEXANDRA</a></h3>

<p>Coat a well-buttered timbale mould with patty paste, and
line it with slices of bacon so as to completely cover the paste.
The slices of bacon in this case are there to prevent the moistening
of the timbale from reaching the paste. Insert a piece
of foie gras into each quail; stiffen them in butter, and set
them against the sides of the timbale in successive tiers.</p>

<p>Completely garnish the middle with small, peeled truffles;
add one-quarter pint of excellent stock with Madeira (per six
quails), and a few bits of bay-leaf. Close the timbale with
a layer of paste and cook in a moderately hot oven for one and
one-quarter hours.</p>

<p>Turn out upon withdrawing from the oven, and serve the
dish as it stands.</p>

<p>N.B.—(1) The shell of paste merely serves to hold in the
quails and their garnish, and ought not to be eaten.</p>

<p>(2) The same timbale may be prepared with ortolans, except
that these need only forty-five minutes’ cooking.</p>

 >1901—CHAUD-FROID DE CAILLES EN BELLE-VUE</a></h3>

<p>The quails should be boned for a chaud-froid, and stuffed with
<i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i> forcemeat of game with a rod of foie gras and another
of truffle set in the middle. This done, reshape them; wrap
them each in a square of muslin; poach them for twenty
minutes in an excellent veal stock, and let them cool therein.</p>

<p>When they are quite cold, dry them; and dip them, so as to
veneer them all over, in a good brown chaud-froid sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.34">34</a>), prepared with quail <i><a href="#g_fumet">fumet</a></i>. Decorate the breast of each
quail elegantly with bits of truffle and poached white of egg;
sprinkle with cold melted savoury jelly, so as to fix the decoration;
and leave to set.</p>

<p>Remove the excess of sauce from around the quails; set
them in a square, deep dish; cover them with very good limpid
savoury jelly, and place them in a refrigerator until they are
required.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1902—Cailles en Caisses"><a id="rcp.1902"

<p>Prepare the quails as for a chaud-froid, as above; but set
each in an oval, pleated case of delicate porcelain or paper.
Border with a thin thread of chopped jelly, and on each quail
set a head, the eyes of which may be imitated by means of a
ring of white of egg and a central spot of truffle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1903—Cailles glacées au Granite"><a id="rcp.1903"
 >1903—CAILLES GLACÉES AU GRANITÉ<!-- TN: original reads "GRANITE" --></a></h3>

<p>I shall only give a few recipes of this class; for the series is
a long one, and I recommend them more particularly on account
of their quaintness. These dishes, wherein a sugary and glazed
preparation is introduced, are highly esteemed in summer; but
they really belong to the culinary repertory of hot countries.</p>


<div class="fakepar"><h3 class="recipe runin" title="1904—Cailles glacées Cerisette"><a id="rcp.1904"

stock, with Champagne. This done, put them each into a small,
oval mould; fill up these moulds with cooking-liquor, cleared of all
grease and strained, and leave them to set on ice.

<p>This preliminary procedure applies to all quail dishes in this
series.</p>

<p>Now prepare a Granité with cherry juice (see No. <a href="#rcp.2930">2930</a>).</p>

<p>Set this Granité in a pyramid on a dish incrusted in ice. Turn

up the rinds with jelly prepared with Port. When about to serve,
deck each orange or tangerine, by means of the piping-bag, with
a small ornament of Granité, prepared with the juice of the
fruit used.</div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1910—Cailles Cecilia"><a id="rcp.1910"
 >1910—CAILLES CECILIA</a></h3>

<p>Roast the quails, keeping them juicy, and leave them to cool.</p>

<p>This done, raise their fillets and skin these; then, with the
remains of the meat and an equal quantity of foie gras, prepare
a purée.</p>

<p>Set each fillet of quail on a similarly-shaped slice of liver,
causing it to adhere by means of the prepared purée, and coat
with brown chaud-froid sauce.</p>

<p>When the sauce has quite set, place these fillets in an even
border-mould, <i><a href="#g_clothe">clothed</a></i> with very limpid aspic, and decorated
with truffles. Fill up the mould with the same aspic jelly,
and let the latter set.</p>

<p>When about to serve, turn out on a napkin, after the manner
of an aspic.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1911—Cailles au Château-Yquem"><a id="rcp.1911"
 >1911—CAILLES AU CHÂTEAU-YQUEM</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the quails like those “à la Richelieu” (No. <a href="#rcp.1895">1895</a>).
After having added the <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i>, sprinkle them with Château-Yquem;
cover; reduce, and complete their cooking as directed.</p>

<p>When they are poached, transfer them to another saucepan;
add ten slices of truffle per quail; strain their cooking-liquor,
through muslin, over them, and poach them for a further two
minutes.</p>

<p>This done, place the quails in a timbale; cover them with the

them raw.</p>

<p>Three-parts garnish the tangerine rinds with a quail <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i>,
combined with foie gras, cut into dice; set a roasted quail’s
fillet on the <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i>; coat with brown chaud-froid sauce, and

Then clear the dish of all grease and serve on a block of ice.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1915—Timbale de Cailles Tzarine"><a id="rcp.1915"
 >1915—TIMBALE DE CAILLES TZARINE</a></h3>

<p>Line a round pie-dish with ordinary paste, and coat it inside
with slices of bacon. In the middle, place a fresh foie gras
seasoned with salt, pepper and allspice, and surround it with
quails, stuffed with quarters of truffles, set upright with their
breasts against the bacon.</p>

<p>Fill up the timbale with whole raw and peeled truffles;
cover with a round slice of bacon; close the timbale with a layer
of paste sealed down round the edges; make a slit in the top,
and bake in a hot oven for one and one-quarter hours.</p>

<p>When withdrawing the timbale from the oven, pour into
it some veal stock flavoured with Madeira, and let it be sufficiently
gelatinous to set like a jelly.</p>

<p>Keep the timbale in the cool for one or two days before
serving it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1916—Cailles à la Vendangeuse"><a id="rcp.1916"
 >1916—CAILLES <span class="nw">A LA VENDANGEUSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Roast the quails; let them cool, and set them, each in a
little dosser of dry paste, resting against a cushion lying on a
round dish. On top of the cushion plant a leafy vine-shoot
bearing grapes. Surround the quails with white and black
grapes (peeled and pipped) and cover with a slightly gelatinous
aspic jelly, prepared with liqueur brandy.</p>

<p>These birds, one or two of which, such as grouse and the
hazel-hen, are of incomparable delicacy and high culinary value,
are mostly served roasted.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a></i>, <i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousselines</a></i> and Salmis are also prepared from
them, after the directions already given. But I must remind
the reader that when they serve in the preparation of a salmis,
their skins and legs, which are bitter, must be discarded.</p>

<p>All these birds must be treated while still very fresh.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1925—Grives et Merles de Corse (Thrushes and Corsican Blackbirds)"><a id="rcp.1925"
 >1925—GRIVES ET MERLES DE CORSE  <span class="nw">(Thrushes and Corsican Blackbirds)</span></a></h3>

<p>The greater part of the quail recipes, more particularly the
“<a href="#g_casserole">en casserole</a>” and “sous la cendre” ones, may be applied
to these excellent birds.</p>

<p>The two following recipes are proper to them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1926—Grives ou Merles à la Bonne-Femme"><a id="rcp.1926"
 >1926—GRIVES OU MERLES <span class="nw">A LA BONNE-FEMME</span></a></h3>

<p>Cook the birds in butter, with one oz. of very small dice of
salted breast of bacon to each bird. Put them into a hot <i>cocotte</i>
with two-thirds oz. of butter per bird; heat; add some square
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> fried in butter; sprinkle with the saucepan-swillings,
which should be a few drops of brandy; cover, and serve very
hot immediately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1927—Grives ou Merles à la Liégeoise"><a id="rcp.1927"
 >1927—GRIVES OU MERLES <span class="nw">A LA LIÉGEOISE</span><!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Cook the birds in butter on the stove, in an uncovered
earthenware saucepan. When they are nearly done, sprinkle
them with two finely-chopped juniper berries per bird; add
some round <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumb fried in butter; cover, and
serve very hot.</p>

<p>This procedure particularly suits thrushes, more especially
when these come from the Ardennes.</p>

<p>The various, cold preparations of quails, except those comprising
a Granité, may be applied to thrushes.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Alouettes ou Mauviettes (Larks)">Alouettes ou Mauviettes (Larks)</h3>

<p>These birds are generally served to the number of two or
three for each person.</p>

 >1929—MAUVIETTES <span class="nw">A LA BONNE-FEMME</span></a></h3>

 >1930—MAUVIETTES <span class="nw">A LA MÈRE MARIANNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Slice some peeled and cored russet apples, and three-parts
cook them in butter. Spread this stew in thick layers on a
buttered dish.</p>

<p>Simply stiffen the seasoned larks in nut-brown butter, and
place them upon the stewed apples, pressing them slightly into
the latter. Sprinkle with very fine bread-crumbs and melted
butter, and set to glaze in the oven or at the Salamander, just
long enough to complete the cooking of the larks.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1931—Alouettes du Père Philippe"><a id="rcp.1931"
 >1931—ALOUETTES DU PÈRE PHILIPPE</a></h3>

<p>Clean some fine, medium-sized potatoes, allowing one to
each lark; and cut a cover from each, which thin down until it
is only one-sixth inch thick. With a root-spoon, hollow out the
potatoes in such wise as to allow of their each enclosing a lark.</p>

<p>Stiffen the larks in butter, and add thereto some salted breast
of bacon, cut into small dice and <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i>, and in the proportion
of one-third oz. per lark. Place a lark in each potato,
together with a few bacon dice and some of the cooking-fat;
return cover of each potato to its place; fix it there by means
of cotton, and wrap each potato in oiled paper.</p>

<p>Lay them on the hearth, cover them with hot cinders, and
cook for about forty minutes, taking care to renew the cinders
from time to time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1932—Mauviettes Froides"><a id="rcp.1932"
 >1932—MAUVIETTES FROIDES</a></h3>

<p>When cold, larks may be prepared in plain chaud-froid
fashion, in cases, in Belle-vue, in Aspic, as <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a></i>, &amp;c., in
pursuance of the directions given under these various recipes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1933—Ortolans"><a id="rcp.1933"
 >1933—ORTOLANS</a></h3>

<p>Serve ortolans as plainly as possible; but the best method
of preparing them is roasting. However, for the sake of variety,
they may be prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1934—Sylphides d’Ortolans"><a id="png.622" href="#png.622"><span class="pagenum"><span

 >1934—SYLPHIDES D’ORTOLANS</a></h3>

<p>Butter some very small porcelain or silver <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i>, and
garnish them half-full with <i><a href="#g_mousseline">mousseline</a></i> forcemeat of ortolans
prepared with truffle essence.</p>

<p>Set these <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> in the front of the oven, that the forcemeat
may poach. Cook in butter, for three minutes only, as
many ortolans as there are garnished <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i>, and proceed
so as to have them just ready when the forcemeat is poached.</p>

<p>Place an ortolan in each <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolette</a></i>, and sprinkle them with
nut-brown butter, combined with a little pale melted glaze and
pineapple juice.</p>

 >1935—BECS-FIGUES ET BEGUINETTES <span class="nw">(Fig Peckers)</span></a></h3>

<p>These birds are not met with in English markets; it is

 ><small>ROASTS AND SALADS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smc">In</span> the first part of this work I explained the fundamental
principles governing the treatment of Roasts, and I now have
to add only a few words to what has already been said. Recipes
may be consummate in detail and in accuracy, and still
they will be found wanting in the matter of Roasts; for experience
alone can tell the operator whether the joint he is
treating be old or young, fresh or stale; whether it must be
cooked quickly or slowly, and all the theories that I might
advance on this subject, though perhaps they might not be
useless, would at least prove impracticable nine times out of
ten.</p>

<p>I shall not prescribe any limit of time for Roasts, except in
very special cases, and even so that limit will only be approximate.</p>

<p>Nothing can be made precise in the matter; long practice
alone, away from books, will teach it; for book-rules can only
be understood when the light of practical knowledge is focussed
upon them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1942—Accompaniment of Roasts"><a id="rcp.1942"
 >1942—ACCOMPANIMENT OF ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>It struck me as desirable that I should give in this chapter
the recipes of the various preparations which, in England, are
served with <span class="nw">Roasts:—</span>Yorkshire Pudding, Veal Stuffing, &amp;c.
Having treated of the accompanying sauces to Roasts in Part I,
I need only recall them here.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1943—Yorkshire Pudding (For Beef Roasts)"><a id="rcp.1943"
 >1943—YORKSHIRE PUDDING (For Beef Roasts)</a></h3>

<p>Mix one-half lb. of sifted flour with six eggs and one quart
of boiled milk, adding the eggs one by one and the milk little
by little. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Pour this preparation into a deep baking-pan, containing
some very hot dripping, and bake in the oven. If the joint be
roasted on the spit, put the Yorkshire pudding under it, on
taking the former out of the oven, and let it thus become
saturated with the gravy and fat that fall from the roast.</p>

<p><a id="png.624" href="#png.624"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>606<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Cut into squares or lozenges, and set these round the Roast
or serve them separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1944—Sage and Onions Stuffing (for Turkeys, Ducks and Geese)"><a id="rcp.1944"
 >1944—SAGE AND ONIONS STUFFING <span class="nw">(For Turkeys, Ducks and Geese)</span></a></h3>

<p>Bake four large onions in the oven with their skins on.
This done, peel them and finely chop them; fry them in butter
with a pinch of dry green chopped sage. Add bread-crumbs,
soaked in milk and pressed, equal in weight to the onions, and
half the weight of chopped veal fat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1945—Veal Stuffing (For Veal and Pork)"><a id="rcp.1945"
 >1945—VEAL STUFFING (For Veal and Pork)</a></h3>

<p>This stuffing is made from equal quantities of chopped
suet, sifted bread-crumbs, and chopped parsley. Season with
salt and pepper as for an ordinary forcemeat, and be liberal
with the nutmeg.</p>

<p>Cohere this forcemeat with three small eggs per two lbs. of
the above preparation.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1946—Roasts of Butcher’s Meat"><a id="rcp.1946"
 >1946—ROASTS OF BUTCHER’S MEAT</a></h3>

<p>I must remind the reader of this principle, viz.: that however
natural it may seem in a dinner to serve a roasted joint
as a Remove, a piece of butcher’s meat must never stand as a
Roast.</p>

<p>Roasts really only comprise <i>Fowl</i> and <i>Feathered Game</i>, provided
the menu only announces one roast. If two are announced,
the second generally consists of some kind of crustacean,
such as a <i>Lobster</i>, a <i>Spiny Lobster</i> or <i>Crayfish</i>, generally
served in the form of a <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i>; or of a preparation of foie
gras, <i>i.e.</i>: either a <i>Pâté</i>, a <i><a href="#g_terrine_1">Terrine</a></i>, a <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i> or a Parfait;
sometimes, too, by a very good ham or a derivative preparation
thereof.</p>

<p>Clear the joint of the vertebræ and the yellow ligaments.
Roast before a moderately fierce fire, and place the joint if possible
in an uncovered braising-pan, the sides of which may protect
the meat during the cooking process.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1948—Roast Upper-fillet"><a id="rcp.1948"
 >1948—ROAST UPPER-FILLET</a></h3>

<p>Break the projecting bones of the vertebræ, and sever the
yellow ligament at various points. For this joint the heat
should be fiercer than in the previous case, the limit of time
being less.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1949—Roast Sirloin"><a id="png.625" href="#png.625"><span class="pagenum"><span

 >1949—ROAST SIRLOIN</a></h3>

<p>These enormous pieces are scarcely trimmed; the excess of
flank alone is suppressed; but the fillet must remain covered
by a considerable thickness of fat, which protects it while
roasting.</p>

<p>Without this precautionary measure, the under-cut would be
cooked long before the upper-fillet, and would dry up.</p>

<p>The fire should be concentrated, regular and not too fierce
for this joint. The flat bones of the vertebræ must be broken
at their base, but not detached.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1950—Fillet of Beef"><a id="rcp.1950"
 >1950—FILLET OF BEEF</a></h3>

<p>Fillet of beef intended for roasting should be carefully cleared
of its two sinewy envelopes. But, since this trimming tends to
let it dry while cooking, were the meat left as it stands, it is
customary to lard it with strips of fresh fat bacon, which protect
it; or it may be wrapped in slices of bacon. In certain circumstances,
it is covered on top and beneath with slices of beef
fat, flattened to the thickness of a rasher of bacon by means of
a beater, and tied on with string.</p>

<p>Fillet of beef should be cooked with a somewhat fierce fire,
and, in England, it is usually kept underdone towards the
centre.</p>

<p>N.B.—Large roast joints of beef are always accompanied
by Yorkshire pudding, grated Horse-radish or Horse-radish
sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.119">119</a> or <a href="#rcp.138">138</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1951—Rôtis de Veau (Veal Roasts)"><a id="rcp.1951"
 >1951—RÔTIS DE VEAU (Veal Roasts)</a></h3>

<p>In my opinion, the spit does not suit veal, whatever be the
quality of the latter. <i>Poëling</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.250">250</a>) is preferable and suits
it better.</p>

<p>The quality of meat can but be enhanced under the treatment
I suggest, more particularly as the <i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i>-liquor constitutes
a much richer gravy than that which generally accompanies
veal roasted on the spit. In English cookery roast veal
is always accompanied by boiled ham or breast of bacon. <i>Veal
Stuffing</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.1945">1945</a>) poached in steam in a special mould, and
cut into slices, is sent at the same time.</p>

<p>Roast joints of veal are generally <i>the Loin</i>, the best end,
the <i>Neck</i> or the <i>Fillet</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, but more rarely, <i>the Cushion</i> is roasted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1952—Mutton and Lamb Roasts"><a id="rcp.1952"
 >1952—MUTTON AND LAMB ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>Mutton and Lamb are the best possible meats to roast,
and, as far as they are concerned, the culinary treatment might
be limited to roasting.</p>

<p><a id="png.626" href="#png.626"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>608<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>True, good results are obtained from poaching mutton and
<i><a href="#g_poele_1">poëling</a></i> home-lamb; but it is advisable only to have recourse
to these methods when a menu requires varying.</p>

<p>The Mutton joints roasted are <i>the Leg</i>, <i>the Double or Pair
of Hind-legs</i>, <i>the Baron</i> or (<i>Hindquarters</i>), <i>the Saddle</i> and <i>the
Neck</i>.</p>

<p>The Shoulder also makes an excellent roast, but it may only
appear on more or less unimportant menus.</p>

<p>Roast joints of mutton and lamb are always accompanied by
Mint Sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.136">136</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1953—Pork Roasts"><a id="rcp.1953"
 >1953—PORK ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>Pork roasts may only appear on very ordinary menus, and
really belong to domestic cookery. The pork joints for roasting
are <i>the Legs</i>, <i>the Fillets</i>, and <i>the Neck</i>.</p>

<p>The joints selected should be those derived from very young
animals, and the rind should be left upon them, and cut deeply
in criss-cross lines, so as to form a lozenge pattern.</p>

<p>Pork should always be roasted before a fierce fire, and it is
accompanied by its gravy and Sage and Onions (No. <a href="#rcp.1944">1944</a>) or
Apple sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.112">112</a>). Sometimes Apple sauce is replaced
by Cranberry sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.115">115</a>); while Roberts sauce Escoffier is
also admirably suited to these roasts.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1954—Venison Roasts"><a id="rcp.1954"
 >1954—VENISON ROASTS</a></h3>

<p>I have already pointed out that Roebuck is not very much
eaten in England, and that this excellent ground game must
be used without having been <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>. Every piece of roebuck
must be trimmed and cleared of tendons, larded with
larding bacon, or, at least, carefully wrapped in the latter; and
roasted before a fierce fire and kept underdone towards the
centre.</p>

<p>The joints of roebuck most commonly roasted are <i>the Legs</i>
and <i>the Saddle</i>.</p>

<p><i>The fallow Deer</i> and <i>the Stag</i> supply the greater part of the
Venison consumed in England; and when these animals are of
good quality their flesh is covered by a thick coat of white fat,
which is very highly esteemed by connoisseurs. Only the neck
and the haunch are roasted, and the latter consists of one leg
with half of the saddle attached.</p>

<p>This venison is never <i><a href="#g_marinade">marinaded</a></i>, but it should be kept for
as long as possible in a dry and well-aired place, that the meat
may be gamy.</p>

<p>Before hanging the joint, dredge it well with a mixture of
flour and pepper, that it may keep dry and free from the flies.</p>

<p><a id="png.627" href="#png.627"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>609<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>When about to prepare this Venison, scrape off the coating
of flour; wrap it in an envelope of firm suet dough. Cover the
whole with oiled paper, tied on with string; and place the
joint before a regular, red fire, concentrated and fierce.</p>

<p>When the joint is thought to be cooked, peel off its envelope;
season it with salt; sprinkle it with a few pinches of flour, and
plenty of melted butter, and brown it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Large joints of Venison allow of the following <span class="nw">adjuncts:—</span><i>Poivrade
sauce</i> and its derivatives, such as <i>Venison sauce</i> and
<i>Grand-Veneur sauce</i>; also <i>the Cumberland</i> and <i>Oxford</i> sauces
of English cookery. Generally a sauceboat of red-currant jelly
is sent with these joints, unless the accompanying sauce already
contains some of it.</p>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Fowl Roasts">Fowl Roasts</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1955—Pullets"><a id="rcp.1955"
 >1955—PULLETS</a></h3>

<p>Large birds, when roasted, should always be salted inside,
trussed and covered with slices of bacon. They should be
cooked before a concentrated and moderately fierce fire. About
ten minutes before unhooking them, remove their covering of
bacon, that their breasts may colour.</p>

<p>A bird is known to be cooked when the juice which issues
from it, if it be held over a plate, is white. Having ascertained
that it is cooked, set it on a very hot dish and serve it instantly.</p>

<p>In England it is customary to surround the fowl with grilled
sausages or slices of bacon, and to send a sauceboat of bread
sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.113">113</a>) at the same time as the gravy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1956—Truffled Pullet"><a id="rcp.1956"
 >1956—TRUFFLED PULLET</a></h3>

<p>Empty the pullet intended for truffling, by means of a little
hole on the side of the belly, and remember to keep the skin of
the neck whole. This done, remove the collar bone at the
summit of the breast, and detach the skin from the whole of
the breast.</p>

<p>For a fine pullet, there will be needed one and one-half lbs.
of truffles.</p>

<p>After having well brushed and washed the truffles, carefully
peel them; select one of the largest; cut it into slices, and put
these aside.</p>

<p>Now quarter the other, letting each piece weigh about three oz.</p>

<p>Pound the truffle peel with two lbs. of very fresh pork fat,
and rub the whole through a sieve. Take about one-half lb. of
this fat; melt it, together with a bay-leaf; and, when it is quite
<a id="png.628" href="#png.628"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>610<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>liquid, add the quartered truffles to it (seasoned with salt and
pepper), and simmer the whole for about ten minutes.</p>

<p>This done, take it off the fire; leave to cool almost entirely
under cover, and mix with what remains of the truffled fat.</p>

<p>Stuff the pullet with this preparation, and slip between the
bird’s skin and the flesh of its breast some thin slices of bacon.
Upon the slices of bacon place the reserved slice of truffle; carefully
sew up all the openings in the pullet with very thin string;
wrap it in one or two sheets of buttered paper; put it on the spit,
and stand it before a concentrated fire which should be kept at
an even heat throughout the process of roasting.</p>

<p>About one-quarter of an hour before serving, remove the
paper and the slices of bacon, that the breast may colour. Set
on a hot dish, and send the gravy, which should be kept rather
fat, separately.</p>

<p>The time allowed for roasting a fine fowl is somewhere
between one and one-quarter to one and one-half hours.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1957—Chicken à la Reine and Spring Chickens"><a id="rcp.1957"
 >1957—CHICKEN <span class="nw">A LA REINE</span> AND SPRING CHICKENS</a></h3>

<h3 class="recipe" title="1958—Spring Chickens à la Russe"><a id="rcp.1958"
 >1958—SPRING CHICKENS <span class="nw">A LA RUSSE</span></a></h3>

<p>Truss the chicken and soak its breast for five minutes in
boiling water, that the flesh and the skin may be stiff.</p>

<p>Lard it with thin strips of bacon and anchovy fillets; fill it
with smooth, truffled sausage-meat, and roast it on the spit.</p>

<p>At the last moment, when the bird is cooked, baste it by
means of a special paper horn, with burning melted bacon fat,
which should frizzle the fowl’s skin as it falls upon it.</p>

<p>Serve a Rémoulade sauce separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1959—Roast Chicks"><a id="rcp.1959"

<p>These birds should, if possible, be cooked “<i><a href="#g_casserole">à la casserole</a></i>.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1960—Roast Young Turkeys"><a id="rcp.1960"
 >1960—ROAST YOUNG TURKEYS</a></h3>

<p>Before trussing the young turkey, clear its legs of all tendons;
an operation effected by means of two incisions made on
the inside of the legs, above and below the last joint. Seize
the tendons one by one; fasten them to a braiding needle, and
gently turn the latter, thus rolling the tendons round it.</p>

<p>Young turkey is covered with slices of bacon and roasted
like the Pullet.</p>

<p>It may be stuffed with Sage and Onions (No. <a href="#rcp.1944">1944</a>), or it
may be accompanied by Veal Stuffing (No. <a href="#rcp.1945">1945</a>), poached in
<a id="png.629" href="#png.629"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>611<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>steam in a special mould, and cut into slices set around the
bird.</p>

<p>It is often accompanied, also, by boiled or grilled bacon, or
grilled sausages. <i>A Bread sauce</i> or <i>a Cranberry sauce</i> may be
served in addition to the gravy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1961—Truffled Young Turkey"><a id="rcp.1961"

<h3 class="recipe" title="1962—Roast Gosling"><a id="rcp.1962"
 >1962—ROAST GOSLING</a></h3>

<p>The Gosling, in order to be roasted, should just have reached
its full growth. In England the bird is stuffed with Sage and
Onions (No. <a href="#rcp.1944">1944</a>), and it is always accompanied by Apple
Sauce (No. <a href="#rcp.112">112</a>).</p>

<p>This roast must not stand waiting, and ought to be served
very hot.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1963—Caneton Rôti (Roast Duckling)"><a id="rcp.1963"
 >1963—CANETON RÔTI (Roast Duckling)</a></h3>

<p>Aylesbury duckling, which is equal to the Nantes variety,
is generally stuffed with Sage and Onions before being roasted.</p>

<p>Its most usual adjunct is Apple Sauce, which is sometimes
replaced by melted, red-currant jelly or a Cranberry Sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1964—Caneton Rouennais"><a id="rcp.1964"

 >1967—HARE</a></h3>

<p>The piece supplied by the hare for roasting is the “<a href="#g_rable">Râble</a>”
(the back), which constitutes that part of the animal reaching
from the root of the neck to the tail, the latter being included.</p>

<p>The “<a href="#g_rable">Râble</a>” should be cleared of all tendons, and delicately
larded with bacon.</p>

<p>Roast before a fierce fire for twenty minutes, and have it only
just done. The usual adjunct to this piece is Poivrade Sauce.
In Northern countries, the adjunct is most commonly some
slightly-sugared, stewed apples, or red currant jelly.</p>

<p><a id="png.630" href="#png.630"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>612<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In Germany, the pan in which the <a href="#g_rable">Râble</a> is roasted is
swilled with sour cream, and this cream constitutes the accompaniment.
Sometimes a few drops of lemon juice or a tablespoon
of melted meat glaze is added.</p>

 >1969—FAISAN RÔTI</a></h3>

<p>Everything I said in the preceding chapter concerning the
classification of feathered game applies in this instance.</p>

<p>All birds intended for roasting should be young, plump,
and fat. They should also be high in the case of pheasants,
partridges, and the various kinds of woodcock and snipe.</p>

<p>A pheasant for roasting should always be covered with slices
of bacon.</p>

<p>An excellent practice which greatly improves the bird is
that of stuffing it with a piece of fresh pork fat, pounded with
peelings of fresh truffles, if possible.</p>

<p>Instead of well-pounded fresh pork fat, an equal weight of
fresh butter may be used.</p>

<p>This fatty substance impregnates the meat when it melts, and
keeps the bird from becoming dry while cooking. The method
also applies to partridge. Roast pheasant is generally accompanied
by two trimmed half-lemons and a dish of potato chips.
The gravy, which should be fat, is served in a sauceboat, and
bread sauce or some bread-crumbs fried in butter are sent at
the same time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1970—Faisan Rôti à la Perigourdine"><a id="rcp.1970"
 >1970—FAISAN RÔTI <span class="nw">A LA PERIGOURDINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Stuff the pheasant with two oz. of pounded fresh pork fat,
two oz. of foie-gras trimmings, and a similar quantity of raw-truffle
parings, the whole pounded together and combined with
one-half lb. of raw truffles, cut into large dice.</p>

<p>After having covered the pheasant with slices of bacon, roast
it in accordance with the directions given under Truffled Pullet.
It is better, however, to cook and serve it in a <i>cocotte</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1971—Faisan à la Gunzbourg"><a id="rcp.1971"
 >1971—FAISAN <span class="nw">A LA GUNZBOURG</span></a></h3>

<p>Bone two fine snipes; empty them of their intestines; fry
these in butter, and crush them on a plate. Chop up the meat
of the snipes, combining half its weight of cream with it, and
as much butter; season with salt and pepper, and add the
crushed intestines and four oz. of truffles cut into large dice.</p>

<p><a id="png.631" href="#png.631"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>613<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Stuff a fine pheasant with this preparation; roast it “<i><a href="#g_casserole">en

<h3 class="recipe" title="1973—Quails"><a id="rcp.1973"

<p>Select them white, very fat, and with the fat firm.</p>

<p>Wrap them in a buttered vine-leaf and a thin slice of bacon,
and roast them before a fierce fire for ten or twelve minutes.</p>

<p>Dish on small bread-crumb <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i>, fried in butter with
half-lemons.</p>

<p>Serve their gravy, which, of course, should be very short,
separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1974—Roast Ortolans"><a id="rcp.1974"
 >1974—ROAST ORTOLANS</a></h3>

<p>Wrap each in a vine-leaf; set them on a tray, moistened
with salted water, and cause them to set in a fierce oven for
four or five minutes.</p>

<p>The small amount of water lying on the bottom of the
utensil produces an evaporation which prevents the ortolans’
fat from melting; consequently there is no need of slices of
bacon, butter, or gravy.</p>

<p>Each ortolan may be served in a half-lemon, shaped like a
basket.</p>

<p>N.B.—The ortolan is sufficient in itself, and it ought only
to be eaten roasted. The products sometimes served as adjuncts
to it, such as truffles and foie gras, are deleterious, if
anything, to its quality, for they modify the delicacy of its
flavour, and this modification is more particularly noticeable
the more highly flavoured the adjunctive products may be.</p>

<p>With its accompaniments it becomes a sumptuous dish, for
the simple reason that it is expensive; but it does not follow
that the true connoisseur will like it; it must be plainly roasted
to suit him.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1975—Ortolans aux Questches"><a id="rcp.1975"
 >1975—ORTOLANS AUX QUESTCHES</a></h3>

<p>Cut two large questches into halves, and allow one half for
each ortolan. Garnish the inside of each with a piece of butter
the size of a hazel-nut; set them on a tray, and put them in the
oven. When they are almost cooked, on each half of the
questches place a moistened ortolan, wrapped in a vine-leaf,
and bake them in a very hot oven for four minutes.</p>

<p>Salt them when taking them out of the oven, and sprinkle
them, by means of a brush, with verjuice.</p>

<p><a id="png.632" href="#png.632"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Heat some fresh butter in a flat, earthenware <i>cocotte</i>, and
allow one-quarter oz. of it to each ortolan. Roll the previously
salted ortolans in this butter, and put them in a very hot oven
for three minutes.</p>

<p>When taking them out of the oven, sprinkle them with a
few tablespoonfuls of very cold pine-apple juice. Cover the
<i>cocotte</i>, and serve immediately.</p>

<p>The <i>cocotte</i> should be just large enough to hold the ortolans.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1977—Roast Woodcock"><a id="rcp.1977"

<p>It should be just sufficiently high. Remove its gizzard;

of fried bread, and serve the swilling-liquor separately, which
in this case should be brandy and a few drops of good game
gravy.</p>

<p>These birds are not covered with slices of bacon; they must
be roasted before a very fierce fire, and kept somewhat underdone.
They must be served as soon as ready, as waiting is
prejudicial to them.</p>

<p>They admit of no accompaniment or garnish, except a very
short gravy.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="     Gelinottes (Hazel-hens)"
 ><span class="nd">1983—</span>GELINOTTES <span class="nw">(Hazel-hens)</span></h3>

<p>These birds must be very fresh when roasted, and should
be kept moderately underdone.</p>

<p>They allow of the same adjuncts as pheasant, <i>i.e.</i>, bread
sauce, bread-crumbs, potato chips, and gravy; and their
breasts alone are served as a rule. Grouse and hazel-hens,
when they are young, make incomparably fine roasts.</p>


<h3 title="Salads">SALADS</h3>

<p>Salads are of two kinds: simple, or compound. Simple, or
raw salads always accompany hot roasts; compound salads,
which generally consist of cooked vegetables, accompany cold
roasts.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1984—The Seasoning of Salads"><a id="rcp.1984"
 >1984—THE SEASONING OF SALADS</a></h3>

<p>1. <i>Oil seasoning</i> may be applied to all salads, and is made
up of three parts of oil to one part of vinegar, with salt and
pepper.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cream seasoning</i> is particularly well suited to salads of
<a id="png.634" href="#png.634"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>616<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>early-season lettuce and cos lettuce, and is made up of three
parts of very fresh and not very thick cream to one part of
vinegar.</p>

<p>3. <i>Egg seasoning</i> is prepared from crushed hard-boiled
yolks of egg, mixed in the salad-bowl with oil, vinegar, salt,
and pepper. The whites of egg, cut into thin strips, are added
to the salad. This seasoning may also be a light mayonnaise
sauce.</p>

<p>4. <i>Bacon seasoning</i> is used especially for dandelion, red-cabbage,
and corn salads. In this case the oil is replaced by
the grease of the bacon dice, which are melted and frizzled
in the omelet-pan. This grease is poured, while hot, with the
bacon dice, over the salad, which should be in a hot salad-bowl
and already seasoned with salt, pepper, and the vinegar which
has served in swilling the omelet-pan.</p>

<p>5. <i>Mustard with cream seasoning</i> is used particularly with
beetroot salads, with salads of celeriac, and with green salads
wherein beetroot plays a major part. It is made up of a
small tablespoonful of mustard, mixed with one-third pint
of fresh and somewhat thin cream, the juice of a fair-sized
lemon, salt, and pepper.</p>

<p>N.B.—I should like to point out that mayonnaise sauce
must only be used in very small quantities in the seasoning
of salads. It is indigestible, and many constitutions cannot
suffer it, especially at night at the end of a dinner.</p>

<p>Raw onion should likewise only be used in salads with
great moderation, in view of the fact that so many do not like
it. In any case, it should be finely <i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i>, washed in fresh
water, and pressed in the corner of a towel.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1985—Simple Salads"><a id="rcp.1985"
 >1985—SIMPLE SALADS</a></h3>

<p>They comprise, in the first place, those salads known under
the name of green salads. Such are lettuce, cos lettuce,
chicory, endive, batavia, celery, corn-salad, dandelion, purslain,
dittander, rampion, salsify leaves, white dandelion, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1986—Salads de Betterave (Beetroot Salad)"><a id="rcp.1986"
 >1986—SALADS DE BETTERAVE <span class="nw">(Beetroot Salad)</span></a></h3>

<p>Beetroot is really the accompaniment of compound and
simple salads, and it is always best to cook it in the oven.
If it be prepared specially as a salad, cut it into a <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> or
into thin roundels; flavour it with onions, first baked in cinders
and then finely chopped, and season it with mustard sauce
or with oil, according to fancy. Always add some chopped
herbs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1987—Celery Salad"><a id="png.635" href="#png.635"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>617<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.1987"
 >1987—CELERY SALAD</a></h3>

<p>For salads, only the fibreless, white celery is used—commonly
known as English celery. Cut it into pieces, and <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i>
these into very thin strips without altogether separating the
latter at their base. Place in cold water for a few hours, that
the strips may curl; drain and season with a mustard sauce
with cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1988—Celeriac Salad"><a id="rcp.1988"
 >1988—CELERIAC SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Cut the celeriac into a fine <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> or <i><a href="#g_paysanne">paysanne</a></i>.</p>

<p>Season, according to fancy, with a mustard sauce with
cream, or a clear mayonnaise sauce containing plenty of
mustard.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1989—Cauliflower Salad"><a id="rcp.1989"
 >1989—CAULIFLOWER SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Divide the cooked and somewhat firm cauliflowers into
small bunches, cleared of all stalk. Season with oil and
vinegar, and flavour with chopped chervil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1990—Red-cabbage Salad"><a id="rcp.1990"
 >1990—RED-CABBAGE SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Suppress the midribs of the leaves; cut the leaves into a
<i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i>, and season them with oil and vinegar six hours in
advance. The <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of cabbages may be parboiled for a few
minutes to modify the rawness of the vegetable; it should then
be cooled and seasoned as above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1991—Cucumber Salad"><a id="rcp.1991"
 >1991—CUCUMBER SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Peel and thinly slice them; sprinkle the slices with table-salt,
and let them stand for two hours. Dry, and season them
with oil, vinegar, and chopped chervil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1992—Haricot Beans and Lentil Salads, etc."><a id="rcp.1992"
 >1992—HARICOT BEANS AND LENTIL SALADS, ETC.</a></h3>

<p>Thoroughly drain the vegetable, whatever be its kind;
season with oil and vinegar, and add some chopped parsley.
Serve separately some thinly-<i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i>, washed, and pressed
onion.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1993—Potato Salad"><a id="rcp.1993"
 >1993—POTATO SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Cut some long, fair-sized potatoes, cooked in salted water
and lukewarm, to the shape of corks, and divide up the latter
into thin roundels.</p>

<p>Season with oil and vinegar, and add some chopped herbs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1994—Potato Salad à la Parisienne"><a id="rcp.1994"
 >1994—POTATO SALAD <span class="nw">A LA PARISIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select potatoes which do not crumble, such as the vitelottes
or new kidney potatoes. Cook them in salted water; cut them
to the shape of corks, and slice them (while still lukewarm) into
thin roundels. Put them into a salad-bowl, and sprinkle them
with two-thirds pint of white wine per two lbs. of potatoes.
<a id="png.636" href="#png.636"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>618<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Then season with oil and vinegar, add some chopped chervil
and parsley, and stir with care lest the roundels break.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1995—Tomato Salad"><a id="rcp.1995"
 >1995—TOMATO SALAD</a></h3>

<p>Select some medium-sized and rather firm tomatoes, and
scald them. Then skin them; cut them in two crosswise;
press them to clear them of juice and seeds; cut them into thin
strips; season them with oil and vinegar, and add some chopped
tarragon.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1996—Compound Salads"><a id="rcp.1996"
 >1996—COMPOUND SALADS</a></h3>

<p>Unless they leave the kitchen to be served immediately,
compound salads are dished without their constituents being
mixed. As the latter are generally of various colours, they
are seasoned and dished in distinct heaps of contrasted shades.</p>

<p>The dishing of compound salads is finished by means of
borders consisting of pieces of very red beetroot, gherkins,
truffles, roundels of potatoes, and radishes. The method of
arranging these vegetables constitutes the decoration, and the
latter, being subject to no rules, is merely a matter of taste.</p>

<p>I do not advise the moulding of compound salads, for the
increased sightliness resulting therefrom is small compared
with the loss in the taste of the preparation. The simplest
form of dishing is the best, and fancifulness should not be
indulged in, beyond the arrangement of the vegetables in a
pyramid, surrounded by a decorated border of jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="1997—Salade Allemande"><a id="rcp.1997"
 >1997—SALADE ALLEMANDE</a></h3>

 >2030—ARTICHOKES WITH DIVERS SAUCES</a></h3>

<p>Cut the artichokes evenly to within two-thirds of their
height; trim them all round; string them, and plunge them
into slightly-salted boiling water. Cook them rather quickly;
drain them well, just before serving them, and remove the
string.</p>

<p>Dish on a napkin, and send a butter, a Hollandaise, or a
mousseline sauce, &amp;c., at the same time.</p>

<p>When artichokes, cooked in this way, have to be served
cold, remove their chokes, dish them on a napkin, and send
a Vinaigrette sauce separately.</p>

 >2031—ARTICHAUTS <span class="nw">A LA PROVENÇALE</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some very small Provençal artichokes; trim them, and
put them in an earthenware stewpan containing some very hot
oil. Season with salt and pepper; cover the stewpan, and
leave to cook for about ten minutes.</p>

<p>Then add, for each twelve artichokes, one pint of very tender,
freshly-shelled peas, and a coarse <i><a href="#g_julienne">julienne</a></i> of one lettuce.</p>

<p>Cover once more, and cook gently without moistening. The
moisture of the peas and the lettuce suffices for the moistening,
provided the stewpan be well covered and the fire be not too
fierce—both of which conditions are necessary to prevent
evaporation on too large a scale.</p>

 >2032—QUARTIERS D’ARTICHAUTS <span class="nw">A L’ITALIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Turn, trim, and quarter some fair-sized artichokes. Trim
the quarters, removing the chokes therefrom; rub them with
a piece of lemon to prevent their blackening; plunge them one
by one into fresh water; parboil and drain them. This done,
set them in a sautépan on a litter of aromatics, as for braising;
make them sweat in the oven for seven or eight minutes;
moisten with white wine; reduce the latter; and moisten again,
to within half their height, with brown stock. Cook gently
in the oven until the quarters are very tender.</p>

<p>When about to serve, set them in a vegetable dish; strain
the cooking-liquor; clear it of grease, and reduce it; add an
Italian sauce to it, and pour this sauce over the quartered
artichokes.</p>

<p>Prepare the artichoke-bottoms as above.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fry a large, chopped onion in butter; add
thereto two-thirds lb. of parboiled and chopped spinach per
twelve artichokes. Stir over an open fire, that all moisture
may evaporate, and add salt and pepper, a piece of crushed
garlic the size of a pea, a tablespoonful of anchovy purée, and
two tablespoonfuls of Velouté. Cook gently for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Stuff the artichoke-bottoms with this preparation; arrange
them on a buttered dish; coat with Mornay sauce; sprinkle
with Gruyère, cut <i><a href="#g_brunoise">brunoise-fashion</a></i>, and set to glaze in a

their cooking in butter, and rub them through a fine sieve,
together with the butter used in cooking.</p>

<p>Put the purée thus obtained in a saucepan, and add to it
the half of its bulk of mashed, very smooth, and creamy
potatoes.</p>

<p>Finish the purée with a little fresh and a little hazel-nut

 >2038—ASPARAGUS (Asperges)</a></h3>

<p>The best-known varieties of asparagus in England <span class="nw">are:—</span></p>

<p>1. The Lauris asparagus, which is par excellence the early-season
kind.</p>

<p>2. The green, Parisian asparagus, which is very small, and
of which the most diminutive sticks, also called sprew, serve
for garnishes.</p>

<p>3. The Argenteuil asparagus—very much in demand while
it is in season.</p>

<p>4. English asparagus, which is somewhat delicate in
quality, but inclined to be small. During the season there
are, besides, several other kinds of asparagus imported from
Spain or France, which, though not equal to the four kinds
above mentioned, may nevertheless be used for soups or garnishes
instead of asparagus-heads or sprew.</p>

<p>Asparagus should be had as fresh as possible; it should
be cleaned with care, quickly washed, tied into faggots, and
cooked in plenty of salted water. Certain kinds, the flavour of
which is somewhat bitter, should be transferred to other water
as soon as cooked, with the view of reducing their bitterness.</p>

<p>Asparagus is dished on special silver drainers, or on
napkins.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2039—Asperges à la Flamande"><a id="rcp.2039"
 >2039—ASPERGES <span class="nw">A LA FLAMANDE</span></a></h3>

<p>According to Flemish custom, asparagus is served with one
hot, hard-boiled half-egg, and one oz. of melted butter per
person. The egg-yolk is crushed, seasoned, and finished with
the butter by the consumers themselves. This accompaniment
may also be prepared beforehand and served in a sauceboat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2040—Asperges au Gratin"><a id="rcp.2040"
 >2040—ASPERGES AU GRATIN</a></h3>

<p>Dish the asparagus in rows, and coat the heads of each
row with a little Mornay sauce. When all are dished, two-thirds
cover the bunch with a band of buttered paper, and
coat the uncovered portion with Mornay sauce. Sprinkle with
grated Parmesan; glaze quickly at the salamander, remove the
paper, and serve at once.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2041—Asperges à la Milanaise"><a id="rcp.2041"
 >2041—ASPERGES <span class="nw">A LA MILANAISE</span></a></h3>

<p>Having thoroughly drained the asparagus, set it on a
long, buttered dish sprinkled with grated Parmesan; arrange
it in successive rows, each of which sprinkle in the region
of the heads with grated Parmesan. When about to serve,
cover the cheese-powdered parts copiously with nut-brown
butter, and set to glaze slightly at the salamander.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2043—Asparagus with Various Sauces"><a id="rcp.2043"
 >2043—ASPARAGUS WITH VARIOUS SAUCES</a></h3>

<p>Butter sauce, Hollandaise, <i>Mousseline</i>, and Maltese sauces
are the most usual adjuncts to asparagus. Béarnaise sauce
without herbs is also served occasionally, likewise melted butter.</p>

<p>When eaten cold, it may be served with oil and vinegar
or a mayonnaise—more particularly a Chantilly mayonnaise,
<i>i.e.</i>, one to which beaten cream has been added.</p>

 >2044—SPREW WITH BUTTER <span class="nw">(Pointes d’Asperges)</span></a></h3>

<p>Sprew or green asparagus is chiefly used for garnishing or
as a garnishing ingredient, but it may also be served as a
vegetable with perfect propriety. Cut the heads into two-inch
lengths, and put them together in faggots.</p>

<p>Cut what remains of them into bits the size of peas. After
having washed the latter, plunge them into boiling salted
water, and cook them quickly, that they may keep green.</p>

<p>This done, thoroughly drain them; let their moisture
evaporate by tossing them over the fire; cohere them with
butter, away from the fire, and dish them in a timbale with the
faggots on top.</p>

<p>They are usually served in small patty crusts, or in small
tartlet crusts, with a few sprew tops on each small patty or
tartlet.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2080—Morels (Morilles)"><a id="rcp.2080"
 >2080—MORELS (Morilles)</a></h3>

<p>The Spring mushroom or Morel is the one most preferred
by connoisseurs. There are two kinds of morels—the pale and
the brown kind—both excellent, though some prefer the former
to the latter, and vice versâ.</p>

<p>In spite of what connoisseurs may say regarding the error
of washing morels, I advocate the operation, and urge the
reader to effect it carefully, and without omitting to open out
the alveolate parts, so as to wash away any sand particles that
may be lodged therein.</p>

<p><i>The Cooking of Morels.</i>—If they be small, leave them
whole; if large, halve or quarter them. After having properly
drained them, put them in a saucepan with two oz. of butter,
the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of salt and another of pepper
per lb. of morels. Boil, and then stew for ten or twelve minutes.
Never forget that the vegetable juices produced by the morels
should be reduced and added to their accompanying sauce.</p>

<p>This excellent vegetable, which has only become known quite
recently, is beginning to be appreciated by connoisseurs. It is
in season from the end of October to the end of March—that
is to say, at a time when cucumbers and vegetable marrows are
over. It greatly resembles these last-named vegetables, and
is prepared like them, while the recipes given for cardoons may

<p>Three kinds of chicory are used for cooking, <span class="nw">viz:—</span></p>

<p>1. Curled chicory, improperly termed “Endive” in
England.</p>

<p>2. Flemish chicory, which is genuine endive in its primitive
state, <i>i.e.</i>, grown in the open air. It greatly resembles <a href="#g_escarole">Escarole</a>.</p>

<p>3. Brussels chicory, or the Belgian kind; obtained from
cultivating the root of Flemish chicory in the dark.</p>

<p>This last kind is quite different from the first two, both with
regard to its quality and its culinary treatment, and it will be
dealt with later under the name of “Endive.”</p>

 >2089—CHICORÉE <span class="nw">A LA CRÈME</span><!-- TN: original reads "CRÉME" --></a></h3>

<p>Parboil the chicory for ten minutes in plenty of boiling
water. Cool it; press the water out of it, and chop it up.</p>

<p>Cohere it with four and one-half oz. of pale roux per two lbs. of chicory; moisten with one quart of consommé; season
with salt and a pinch of powdered sugar, and braise in the
oven, under cover, for one and one-half hours.</p>

<p>Upon withdrawing it from the oven, transfer it to another
saucepan; add three-fifths pint of cream and two oz. of butter,
and dish in a timbale.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2090—Pain de Chicorée"><a id="rcp.2090"
 >2090—PAIN DE CHICORÉE</a></h3>

<p>Braise the chicory as described above.</p>

<p>Upon withdrawing it from the oven, mix with it (per lb.)
five stiffly-beaten eggs; put it into an even, buttered mould,
and set to poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>Before unmoulding the “loaf,” let it rest awhile, that the

with a cream sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2091—Purée de Chicorée"><a id="rcp.2091"

<p>Whatever be the purpose for which they are intended, endives
should always be cooked preparatively as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>After having washed and cleaned them, put them in a well-tinned
saucepan containing (per three lbs. of endives) a liquor
prepared from the juice of a lemon, a pinch of salt, one oz.
of butter, and one-fifth pint of water. Cover the saucepan;
boil quickly, and complete the cooking on the side of the fire
for from thirty to thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Endives may thus be served plain, and constitute a very
favourite vegetable or garnish. They may accompany all
Relevés of butcher’s meat.</p>

<p>Some cardoon recipes may also be applied to them, more
particularly <i>à la Mornay</i>, <i>à la Crème</i>, and <i>à la Milanaise</i>—all
of which suit them admirably.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2095—Cabbages (Choux)"><a id="rcp.2095"

<p>From the culinary standpoint, cabbages may be divided into
seven classes, as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>1. White cabbages: used almost solely in the preparation
of sauerkraut.</p>

<p>2. Red cabbages: used as a vegetable, as a hors-d’œuvre,
or as a condiment.</p>

<p>3. Round-headed or Savoy cabbages: specially suited to
braising and the English method of cooking.</p>

<p>4. Scotch kale and spring cabbages: always prepared in
the English fashion.</p>

<p>5. Cauliflowers and broccoli: the flower of these is most
<a id="png.657" href="#png.657"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>639<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>commonly used, but the leaves are cooked in the English way
when they are tender.</p>

<p>6. Brussels sprouts.</p>

<p>7. Kohlrabi: the roots of these may be dished as turnips,
and the leaves cooked in the English way, provided they be
young and tender.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2096—White Cabbages (Choux Blancs)"><a id="rcp.2096"
 >2096—WHITE CABBAGES <span class="nw">(Choux Blancs)</span></a></h3>

<p>In an extreme case, these cabbages may be braised like the
green Savoys, but they are usually too firm, and they are therefore
only used in the preparation of sauerkraut.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2097—Sauerkraut (Choucroûte)"><a id="rcp.2097"
 >2097—SAUERKRAUT (Choucroûte)</a></h3>

<p>If the sauerkraut be somewhat old, set it to soak in cold
water for a few hours. It is best, however, to avoid this
measure, if possible, and to use only fresh sauerkraut.</p>

<p>When about to cook it, drain it, if it has been soaked, and
press all the water out of it. Then pull it to pieces in such
a way as to leave no massed leaves; season it with salt and
pepper, and put it into a braising-pan lined with slices of bacon.
Add, for ten lbs. of sauerkraut, three quartered carrots, three
medium-sized onions, each stuck with a clove, a large faggot,
three oz. of juniper berries and one-half oz. of peppercorns
contained in a canvas bag, six oz. of goose dripping or lard,
and one lb. of <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> breast of bacon, the latter to be withdrawn
after one hour’s cooking.</p>

<p>Moisten, just enough to cover, with white consommé; cover
with slices of bacon; boil, and then cook in the oven for five
hours with lid on.</p>

<p><i>To serve Sauerkraut.</i>—Withdraw the vegetables, the faggot,
and the juniper berries, and set the sauerkraut in a timbale,
after having well drained it.</p>

<p>Surround it with thin slices of ham, rectangles of bacon,
and some poached Frankfort or Strasburg sausages.</p>

<p>Broccoli differs from cauliflower in the colour of its flower
and the arrangement of the parts of the latter. In the
broccoli the flower is of a deep violet. English broccoli never
reach the size of those grown in the South of France.</p>

<p>Many do not even grow to a head, while their flowers—the
size of hazel-nuts—are scattered among the interstices of the
surrounding leaves.</p>

<p>Cauliflowers and large broccoli allow of the same treatment.</p>

bring it to its proper consistence.</p>

 >2155—FLAGEOLETS <span class="nw">(Haricots Flageolets)</span></a></h3>

<p>These beans are used more especially fresh; but, when they
are out of season, recourse is often had to preserved or dried
flageolets.</p>

<p>They are prepared in the same way as haricot-beans. Their
purée, which is very delicate, is known under the name of
“Purée Musard,” and it is particularly suitable for the garnishing
of mutton. It is also used as a thickening ingredient
in the purée of French beans, and nothing can equal it for the
purpose; for, not only is it an unctuous thickening medium, but
its flavour is peculiarly adapted to the throwing into relief of
that of the French beans.</p>

<p>Red beans are cooked in salted water with one-third lb. of
lean bacon, one pint of red wine, one carrot, one onion stuck
with a clove, and one faggot per quart of beans. The bacon
should be withdrawn as soon as cooked. These beans are
cohered by means of <i><a href="#g_manied">manied</a></i> butter, and they are then mixed
with the bacon, which is cut into dice and frizzled in butter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2157—French Beans (Haricots Verts)"><a id="rcp.2157"
 >2157—FRENCH BEANS <span class="nw">(Haricots Verts)</span></a></h3>

<p>French beans are among the greatest vegetable delicacies;
but they have to be prepared with the utmost care.</p>

<p>Their quality is such that they are almost always good, in
spite of faulty preparation—so common in their case; but, when
they are cooked with care, no other vegetable can surpass them
in perfection of flavour. They should be taken quite fresh, and
they should not be cooked too long. They are best when they
seem a little firm to the teeth, without, of course, being in the
least hard.</p>

<p>They must not be cooled when cooked; they should only be
<i><a href="#g_saute_1">sautéd</a></i> over the fire with the view of causing the evaporation of
their moisture.</p>

<p>After having seasoned them with salt and pepper, add to
them (per lb.) about three oz. of very fresh butter, cut into
small pieces; <i><a href="#g_saute_1">sauté</a></i> them so as to effect their leason, and
straightway serve them.</p>

<p>Do not add chopped parsley to French beans, unless it be
very tender and gathered and chopped at the last moment.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2158—Haricots Panachés"><a id="rcp.2158"

<p>As this vegetable is sold already cooked at English markets,

<h3 class="recipe" title="2169—Maize (Maïs)"><a id="rcp.2169"
 >2169—MAIZE (Maïs)</a></h3>

<p>Take the maize when it is quite fresh and still milky, and
cook it either in steam or salted water; taking care to retain
the leaves on the ears. When cooked, the leaves are drawn
<a id="png.670" href="#png.670"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>652<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>back so as to represent stalks, and the ears are bared if they
be served whole. This done, set the ears on a napkin, and
send a hors-d’œuvre dish of fresh butter to the table with
them.</p>

<p>If the maize has to be grilled, put the ears on a grill in the
oven, and, when they have swollen and are of a golden colour,
withdraw the grains and set the latter on a napkin. Sometimes,
too, the ears are served whole.</p>

<p>When maize is served as an accompaniment, the grains are
separated from the stalk and cohered with butter or cream,
exactly like peas.</p>

<p>Failing fresh maize, excellent preserved kinds are to be
found on the market.</p>

<p>Cook the maize in water or steam; rub it quickly through
tammy; put it into a saucepan with a small piece of butter, and
quickly dry it.</p>

<p>This done, add sufficient fresh cream to this purée to make a
somewhat soft paste. Thicken this paste with the yolks of three
eggs, per lb. of purée, and combine it with the whites of four
eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Mould and cook after the manner
of an ordinary <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i>.</p>

ease.</p>

<p>Or, split them open in the same way; put them in small

<p>Take some very large chestnuts, and dip them in hot fat in
order to peel them. Then set them in one layer, one against
the other in a sautépan. If they were heaped, only a poor
result could be obtained.</p>

<p>Moisten them, just enough to cover, with strong veal stock,
and stir them as little as possible while they are cooking, so
as to avoid breaking them.</p>

<p>When they are three-parts cooked, reduce the moistening,
and gently roll the chestnuts in the glaze resulting from this
reduction, that they may be covered with a brilliant coating.</p>

<p>Chestnuts prepared in this way serve more particularly as
a garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2175—Purée de Marrons"><a id="rcp.2175"

<p>They may also be served stuffed, after the following <span class="nw">recipes:—</span></p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2177—Stuffed Turnips.—A"><a id="rcp.2177"
 >2177—STUFFED TURNIPS.—<i>A</i></a></h3>

<p>Take some round, medium-sized turnips, fairly equal in size.
Peel them, and, in so doing, shape them nicely; then, by means
of a round fancy-cutter, cut them deeply at their base, pressing
the instrument into the pulp.</p>

<p>This done, thoroughly parboil and empty them.</p>

<p>With the withdrawn pulp, prepare a purée, to which add an
equal quantity of mashed potatoes. Garnish the turnips with
this purée, and shape the visible portion of the latter dome-fashion.</p>

<p>Set the stuffed turnips in a sautépan, and complete their
cooking in butter, taking care to baste them frequently.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2178—Stuffed Turnips.—B"><a id="rcp.2178"
 >2178—STUFFED TURNIPS.—<i>B</i></a></h3>

<p>Prepare the turnips as above; but stuff them with a preparation

grated Parmesan.</p>

<p><a id="png.672" href="#png.672"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>654<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Complete the cooking as directed in the preceding recipe.</p>

<p>N.B.—Proceeding in the same way, turnips may be stuffed
with spinach, chicory, and even with farinaceous vegetables or
rice, kept very creamy. All these garnishes are at once sightly
and excellent.</p>

<p>Take some medium-sized, mild, Spanish onions; cut them
at a point one-quarter of their height from the top, and parboil
them thoroughly.</p>

<p>Empty them, leaving only a wall one-third in. thick; chop
up the withdrawn parts, and mix them with an equal quantity
of Duxelles (No. <a href="#rcp.225">225</a>).</p>

<p>Garnish the emptied onions with this preparation; complete
their cooking by braising them, and glaze them at the last
moment, simultaneously with the formation of the <i><a href="#g_gratin">gratin</a></i>.</p>

<p>N.B.—Proceed in the same way for onions stuffed with
spinach, Rizotto, or semolina, &amp;c., as suggested under Nos. <a href="#rcp.2177">2177</a>
and <a href="#rcp.2178">2178</a>.</p>

<p>Onions may also be garnished with a <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> preparation of

<p>Take a saucepan, of a size a little larger than would be necessary

quart of freshly-shelled peas; a faggot containing the heart of
a lettuce, two sprays of parsley, and two of chervil; twelve
small onions, four oz. of butter, one-third oz. of salt, and two-thirds oz. of loaf-sugar. Mix the whole together until it forms
a compact mass, and place in the cool until ready for cooking.
Add three tablespoonfuls of water, when about to cook the peas,
and cook gently with lid on.</p>

<p>When about to serve, withdraw the faggot; <i><a href="#g_cisel">cisel</a></i> the lettuce;
add it to the peas, and cohere the whole with butter, away from
the fire.</p>

<p>N.B.—Raw, <i><a href="#g_cisel">ciseled</a></i> lettuce may be added to the peas; but,
as various tastes must be allowed for, it is better to insert the

When the peas are cooked, drain them; and reduce

<p>The large or mild capsicums, green, red, or yellow, are used
more particularly as garnishes. Although the difference in
their colouration is accompanied by a difference of quality, they
are not easily distinguished in this respect; and, although the
large, red Spanish capsicums are the best, the other varieties
may be treated in the same way as the former.</p>

<p>Whatever be the kind of capsicums used, either grill or
scald them in order to skin them, and clear them of their seeds.
According to the purpose they are intended for, they are either
cut up or left whole.</p>

<p>For this purpose take some small, green, carrot-shaped capsicums.</p>

<p>Remove their stems, after having skinned them; empty them,
and half-fill them with half-cooked, pilaff rice.</p>

<p>Then set them in a sautépan, and carefully braise them with
excellent stock.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2199—Capsicums for Garnishing"><a id="rcp.2199"
 >2199—CAPSICUMS FOR GARNISHING</a></h3>

<p>For this purpose, the large red, Spanish capsicums are best.</p>

<p>Braise them when they are peeled, and, when cooked, cut
them up as the requirements may suggest.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2200—Purée de Pimentos"><a id="rcp.2200"
 >2200—PURÉE DE PIMENTOS</a></h3>

<p>Braise some large, red capsicums, with two-thirds of their
weight of rice. When the whole is well cooked, rub it through
a sieve, and add butter to the extent of two oz. per quart of the

and white meats, and it is well to keep it thin.</p>

proceed in the same way with a second layer.</p>

<p>Make five or six layers in this way, seasoning and spreading
butter over each.</p>

<p>Cover the utensil; cook in a good oven for thirty minutes;

<p>For this purpose, when it is cooked, it is combined (per quart)
with a little cream, four oz. of foie-gras dice, and as much
truffle, also in dice. The rice should only be three-parts cooked
for stuffings; for it completes its cooking inside the bird. For
this reason the cream is added, that the rice may absorb it
while its cooking is being completed.</p>

butter. Moisten the rice with about one quart of consommé
per lb. The consommé should be added to the rice in seven

supply should be forthcoming. When adding the liquor, stir
the rice with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Cook the rice under cover, and, to the resulting preparation,

<p>Rub this estouffade through a sieve and put it aside.</p>

<p>Parboil some thick macaroni, keeping it somewhat firm;
drain it; cut it into short lengths, and cohere it with butter.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the bottom of a timbale with grated cheese; cover
with a layer of estouffade purée; spread a layer of macaroni

<h3 class="recipe" title="2297—The Preparation of Ravioli"><a id="rcp.2297"
 >2297—THE PREPARATION OF RAVIOLI</a></h3>

<p>They may be made in various shapes as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Roll a piece of noodle paste to a thin layer and stamp it
out with a grooved cutter, two and one-half in. in diameter.
Moisten the edges of each roundel of paste; garnish the centre
<a id="png.695" href="#png.695"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>of each with a ball of one of the above stuffings, the size of a
hazel-nut, and fold in slipper-form.</p>

<p>(2) Roll the paste into a rectangle of four-in. sides; garnish
with stuffing, leaving a gap between the portions of the latter;
moisten the edges of the paste, and close up by drawing these
together. Finally stamp out with a grooved, crescent-shaped

<p>(3) Prepare a square layer of paste; garnish it with lines consisting
of portions of paste; leave a space of two in. between the
lines. Moisten; cover with a second layer of paste, of the
same dimensions as the first, and divide up, by means of the
roulette, into squares of two-in. sides. Whatever be the shape
of the <a href="#g_ravioli"><i>ravioli</i></a>, plunge them into a saucepan of slightly salted

<h3 class="recipe" title="2298—Remarks upon Savouries"><a id="rcp.2298"
 >2298—REMARKS UPON SAVOURIES</a></h3>

<p><span class="smc">I have</span> already expressed my opinion in regard to Savouries.
I consider their use opposed to gastronomical principles, and
that they have no <i>raison d’être</i> on a good menu. But, not
wishing to seem didactic, I shall give, hereafter, a few savoury
recipes, selected from among those which are gastronomically
the best, and which custom has sanctified.</p>

<p>I resolved to make these recipes appear after the Vegetables
and before the Ices, because I deem that Dessert alone is admissible
after the Entremets and Ices.</p>

<p>There is much in common between Hors-d’œuvres and
Savouries. Many of the former, the recipes for which I have
given, may appear as Savouries, once their seasoning has been
intensified. Among the latter class may be quoted the various
Tartlets (No. <a href="#rcp.387">387</a>, &amp;c.); the <a href="#g_barquettes">Barquettes</a> (No. <a href="#rcp.314">314</a>); Frivolities
(No. <a href="#rcp.350">350</a>); Éclairs à la Karoly (No. <a href="#rcp.344">344</a>); Allumettes aux
Anchois (No. <a href="#rcp.300">300</a>); City Toasts (No. <a href="#rcp.320">320</a>), &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2299—Allumettes"><a id="rcp.2299"
 >2299—ALLUMETTES</a></h3>

<p>Prepare a ribbon of puff-paste three inches wide by one-fifth
inch thick, leaving the length to come as it will. Spread
on it some very reduced Béchamel sauce, combined with two
tablespoonfuls of grated Gruyère cheese per one-half pint, and
season with cayenne. Sprinkle the surface with grated
Parmesan; press the latter into the sauce by means of the flat
of a knife; cut into rectangles one inch wide; set these on a
slightly-moistened tray, and bake them in a moderate oven
for twelve minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2300—Beignets Soufflés with Cheese"><a id="rcp.2300"
 >2300—BEIGNETS SOUFFLÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible --> WITH CHEESE</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some ordinary “pâte à choux” without sugar
(No. <a href="#rcp.2375">2375</a>), and combine it, per lb., with five oz. of a <i><a href="#g_brunoise">Brunoise</a></i>
of Gruyère.</p>

<p>Divide up this paste into portions the size of hazel-nut, and
fry them in fat like other Beignets <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2301—Beurrecks à la Turque"><a id="png.697" href="#png.697"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2301"
 >2301—BEURRECKS <span class="nw">A LA TURQUE</span></a></h3>

<p>Reduce the required amount of Béchamel sauce to a thick
consistence; mix it with an equal quantity of Gruyère dice;
season with cayenne, and spread the preparation on a dish to
cool.</p>

<p>Then divide it up into portions the size of fine walnuts;
shape these like cigars, wrap each portion in a very thin layer
of noodle paste; treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and fry them at the
last moment in very hot fat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2302—Choux au Fromage"><a id="rcp.2302"
 >2302—CHOUX AU FROMAGE</a></h3>

<p>By means of a piping-bag, form some “<a href="#g_choux">choux</a>,” a little
larger than the Saint-Honoré ones, from ordinary paste (see
No. <a href="#rcp.2375">2375</a>). <i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i> them with beaten eggs; bake them in a
moderate oven, and keep them dry. When cold, cut them at
the top; garnish them with “<i><a href="#g_fondue">Fondue</a> au fromage</i>” seasoned
with cayenne, and complete with some Chantilly cream, combined
with grated Parmesan; this should be laid on by means
of a piping-bag, as in the case of “choux à la crème.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2303—Camembert Frit"><a id="rcp.2303"
 >2303—CAMEMBERT FRIT</a></h3>

<p>Clear the cheese of its crust, and cut it into elongated
lozenges. Sprinkle the latter with cayenne, treat them twice
<a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, and fry them at the last moment in hot fat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2304—Canapes or Toast"><a id="rcp.2304"
 >2304—CANAPES OR TOAST</a></h3>

<p>These are nothing more than pieces of toast, <i>i.e.</i>, slices of
bread, trimmed according to fancy, grilled, buttered, and
garnished in some way.</p>

<p>As the garnishes for toast are innumerable, I shall quote
only a few typical examples.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> Garnished with Scrambled Eggs.</i>—Set the
scrambled eggs in domes upon the <a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a>; sprinkle with
grated Parmesan, and set to glaze quickly.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> arrange the scrambled eggs as above, and cover them
with a lattice of anchovy fillets.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> de Haddock.</i>—Cook the haddock; rub it through a
sieve; add a little butter and Béchamel sauce to the resulting
purée, and set the latter in domes on the toast.</p>

<p><i>For Variety.</i>—Sprinkle the purée with grated Parmesan, and
set to glaze.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> garnish the purée with oysters poached in a little
Worcestershire sauce.</p>

<p><i>Or again</i>: cover the purée with a lattice of anchovy fillets.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> with Kippers or Bloaters.</i>—Grill them and make
a purée from them like the haddock.</p>

<p><a id="png.698" href="#png.698"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>680<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> with Halved or Filleted Anchovies.</i>—In the case of
fillets, set them to form a grill upon the toast; if the anchovies
be halved, lay them lengthwise on the toast.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> with Sardines in Oil.</i>—Clear the fish of their skins
and bones, and set the fillets on the <a href="#g_canape">canapés</a>.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> with Grilled Sprats.</i>—Proceed as for sardines.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a> of Salmon.</i>—Toast may be garnished with thin
slices of smoked or fresh salmon, or with the latter prepared
in a purée like the haddock.</p>

<p><i>Various <a href="#g_canape">Canapés</a>.</i>—Once the pieces of toast or <a href="#g_canape">canapés</a> are
grilled and buttered, they may be garnished with chopped
smoked tongue or ham, cohered with a little butter and
mustard, with grilled slices of mushrooms or tomatoes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A few of the preparations have names, while others are
only distinguished by the nature of their garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2305—Canapes à la Cadogan"><a id="rcp.2305"
 >2305—CANAPES <span class="nw">A LA CADOGAN</span></a></h3>

<p>Take oval and slightly hollowed pieces of toast, fried in
butter and garnished with spinach prepared with butter. Lay
two oysters on the spinach of each piece of toast; cover with

 >2306—CANAPES DES GOURMETS</a></h3>

<p>Prepare some very thin pieces of toast; fry them in butter,

<h3 class="recipe" title="2307—Canapes Ivanhoe"><a id="rcp.2307"
 >2307—CANAPES IVANHOE</a></h3>

<p>Take some round, buttered pieces of toast, garnished with
haddock purée, and set a very small, grilled mushroom on the

 >2308—CANAPES <span class="nw">A L’ÉCOSSAISE</span><!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Take some round, buttered pieces of toast, garnished with
haddock purée, and glazed.</p>

<p>N.B.—I see no use in extending this list any further; the
above directions should suffice to show the variety to which
these preparations lend themselves.</p>

 </span></span></a>butter, the size of a hazel-nut, and one-half coffeespoonful of
cream.</p>

<p>Set a mushroom on each piece of toast, which should be
two inches in diameter and fried in butter. Dish them on an
egg-tray, and cover them with a special, small, glass bell,
four inches in diameter and two inches high, the rim of which
must rest on the bottom of a dish, the diameter of which should
be such as to fit the bell.</p>

<p>Put the dishes on the side of the stove, and cook in moderate
heat for about twenty-five minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2311—Condés au Fromage"><a id="rcp.2311"
 >2311—CONDÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible --> AU FROMAGE</a></h3>

<p>This may be prepared in two ways, but always on square
or rectangular pieces of buttered toast, one-third inch thick.</p>

<p>1. The simplest way is to cover the pieces of toast with a
thick layer of grated Gloucester or Chester cheese, to sprinkle
them with cayenne, and then to place them in the oven for the
cheese to melt and thereby glaze their surfaces.</p>

<p>2. The original method consists in melting the dice or slices
of cheese in a few tablespoonfuls of pale ale and a little English
mustard.</p>

<p>As soon as the cheese has melted, it is poured over the
pieces of buttered toast, quickly smoothed with the flat of
a knife, and sprinkled with cayenne. The pieces may be cut
up if required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2336—Sandwiches"><a id="rcp.2336"
 >2336—SANDWICHES</a></h3>

<p>Sandwiches are prepared in two ways, according to their
purposes.</p>

<p>They generally consist of two slices of buttered bread, with
mustard spread upon them, covering a slice of ham or tongue, &amp;c.
Sandwiches are usually rectangular, and they should
measure about three inches by one and one-half inches. The
kind served at ball buffets are much smaller, and therefore it is
best to cut the sandwiched product (whatever this be) into dice,
and to mix it with an equal weight of butter containing mustard.</p>

<p>When sandwiches have to be kept, they should be placed
under a slight weight to prevent the bread from drying. Sandwiches
may also be made from thick, toasted slices of bread, cut
laterally into two, and then garnished according to fancy.</p>

<p>In his book, “La Cuisine Anglaise,” Mr. Suzanne gives
the following kind of sandwich, which deserves <span class="nw">attention:—</span></p>

<p><a id="png.704" href="#png.704"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>686<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This kind of sandwich, which is liked by racing people, is a
most substantial affair, and it will be seen from the following
recipe that a sandwich of the nature prescribed might, in an
emergency, answer the purpose of a meal.</p>

<p>Take an English tin-loaf, and cut off its two end crusts,
leaving on them about one-third inch of crumb. Butter these
crusts. Meanwhile grill a thick steak, well seasoned with salt
and pepper. When it is cooked, cool it; sprinkle it with grated
horse-radish and mustard, and lay it between the two crusts.
String the whole together as for a galantine, and wrap it in
several sheets of blotting-paper. Then place the parcel under
a letter-press, the screw of which should be gradually tightened,
and leave the sandwich thus for one-half hour.</p>

<p>At the end of this time the insides of the slices of bread
have, owing to the pressure, become saturated with meat juice,
which is prevented from escaping by the covering of crust.</p>

<p>Remove the blotting-paper, and pack the sandwich in a box
or in several sheets of white paper.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Pastry</span>, Confectionery, and Ices are so closely allied to
Cookery, and they are so surely its complements, that it is
impossible to omit them when dealing with Entremets, even
though the latter be limited to the kind proper to the kitchen.</p>

<p>However, these subjects, which could supply matter for
voluminous works, are too complex for it to be possible to cope
thoroughly with them here.</p>

<p>I shall therefore confine myself to the expounding of their
fundamental principles and the essential operations relating
thereto, a knowledge of which is absolutely necessary for the
successful preparation of Kitchen Entremets and Ices. The
directions given hereafter are certainly too inadequate to convert
an ordinary cook into a pastry-cook, a confectioner, or a
“glacier”; but they will at least admit of his carrying out a
complete dinner, if the necessity so to do should occur.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2338—Various Almond Preparations"><a id="rcp.2338"
 >2338—VARIOUS ALMOND PREPARATIONS</a></h3>

<p>It is important that one should have skinned, splintered,
and chopped almonds.</p>

<p><i>To Skin Almonds.</i>—Throw them in a saucepan of boiling
water, place the utensil on the side of the fire without allowing
the boiling to continue, and let the almonds soak for seven
or eight minutes. As soon as the skin slips when pressing
them between one’s fingers, turn them out on to a strainer; cool
them in cold water, and skin them. This done, wash them in
cold water; drain them well; spread them on a very clean
tray, and dry them in a mild oven.</p>

<p><i>Splintered Almonds.</i>—Having skinned and washed the
almonds, split them in two, and cut each half into five or
six splinters. Dry the latter in the drying-box, and place
them in the front of the oven for a while to colour slightly.</p>

<p><a id="png.706" href="#png.706"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>688<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>They serve for nougat, and sometimes take the place of
pignolis.</p>

<p><i>Chopped Almonds.</i>—Having skinned the almonds, slightly
dry them and chop them with a knife; rub them through a
canvas sieve, the coarseness of which should be in accordance
with that required for the chopped almonds.</p>

<p>Spread the latter on a tray covered with a sheet of paper,
and dry them in the drying-box, stirring them from time to
time the while.</p>

<p><i>Grilled Almonds.</i>—These are either splintered or chopped
almonds set to bake on a tray in a moderate oven. Be sure
to stir them frequently, that they may colour evenly, and withdraw
them when they are of a nice golden shade.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_pralined">Pralined</a> Almonds.</i>—Proceed as for grilled almonds, but
sprinkle them frequently with icing sugar, which turns to
caramel under the influence of the heat of the oven, and swathes
the almonds in a pale-brown coat of sugar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2339—Various Preparations of Filberts and Hazel-nuts"><a id="rcp.2339"
 >2339—VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF FILBERTS AND HAZEL-NUTS</a></h3>

<p>Filberts are a large kind of hazel-nut, generally covered
with red skins.</p>

<p>After having cracked and suppressed the shells, set the filberts
on a dish, and place them in the front of the oven until
their skins are slightly grilled. They need then only be rubbed
between the fingers in order to clear them of their skins.
Chopped filberts are prepared like chopped almonds, and should
be included in the permanent “<i><a href="#g_mise-en-place">mise en place</a></i>” of the pastry
cook.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2340—Various Butters"><a id="rcp.2340"
 >2340—VARIOUS BUTTERS</a></h3>

<p><i>Softened Butter.</i>—More particularly in winter, when it is
very hard, butter should be softened, <i>i.e.</i>, thoroughly kneaded
in a towel, <span class="nw">to:—</span></p>

<p>1. Extract the butter-milk, which is always present in more
or less large quantities.</p>

<p>2. Make it sufficiently soft to mix with the various ingredients
of which the pastes are made up.</p>

<p><i>Pomaded Butter.</i>—After having well softened it as above,
put it in a bowl or basin, previously rinsed with hot water
and thoroughly wiped. Work the butter with a spatula or a
wooden spoon until it acquires the consistence of a pomade—a
necessary condition for certain of its uses.</p>

<p><i>Clarified Butter.</i>—In pastry, clarified butter is used more
especially for the buttering of moulds. Put the butter to be
clarified into a saucepan, and cook it over a very slow fire until
<a id="png.707" href="#png.707"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>689<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>(1) the caseous substances liberated in the cooking process have
accumulated and solidified on the bottom of the saucepan; (2) it
appears limpid, of a golden colour, and exhales a slight, nutty
smell.</p>

<p>Strain it through muslin, and put it aside until required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2341—The Buttering and Glazing of Moulds"><a id="rcp.2341"
 >2341—THE BUTTERING AND GLAZING OF MOULDS</a></h3>

<p>All moulds, large and small, should be buttered so as to
ensure the easy turning-out of cakes cooked in them. Clarified
butter, owing to its purity, is the best for the purpose. It may
be applied with a brush, care being taken that all the inside
surfaces get uniformly covered with it. One unbuttered spot
is sufficient to make a moulding stick, or to completely spoil a
cake.</p>

<p>For certain cakes, chopped or splintered almonds are
sprinkled in the mould. For others, especially biscuits, the
moulds are flour-dusted—that is to say, a veil of very dry flour
or fecula is allowed to settle on the layer of butter, which, at
the turning out, appears like a glazed crust upon the cake.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2342—How to Beat the Whites of Eggs"><a id="rcp.2342"
 >2342—HOW TO BEAT THE WHITES OF EGGS</a></h3>

<p>The best utensil for the purpose is a copper or nickel basin
in which the whisk may act at all points owing to the spherical
shape of the receptacle. Tinned or enamelled utensils set up
a kind of greasiness which does not allow of one’s bringing the
whites to the stiffness necessary for some purposes.</p>

<p>Begin whisking the whites gently, and draw them up with
the whisk until all their molecules have disaggregated and they
begin to stiffen. They may then be whisked until they are
sufficiently stiff to be taken up bodily by the whisk.</p>

<p><i>Preventive Means.</i>—To facilitate the beating of whites of
eggs, there may be added to them at the start a pinch either
of salt or alum per ten whites. When, towards the close of the
operation, the whites begin to granulate, owing to any one of
the various causes, add immediately one tablespoonful of
powdered sugar per ten whites, and then whisk briskly, to
restore them to their normal state.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2343—Vegetable Colouring Matters"><a id="rcp.2343"
 >2343—VEGETABLE COLOURING MATTERS</a></h3>

<p>Every pastry-cook’s stock should include a series of vegetable
colouring matters, comprising carmine, liquid spinach
green, yellow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When required, the blending of these colours yields the
intermediate tones. The colours may be bought.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2344—The Cooking of Sugar" id="g_sugar"><a id="png.708" href="#png.708"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>690<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2344"
 >2344—THE COOKING OF SUGAR</a></h3>

<p>From the state of syrup to the most highly-concentrated
state in which it is used in pastry sugar passes through various
stages of cooking, which <span class="nw">are:—</span>The small thread (215° F.) and
the large thread (222° F.), the small ball (236° F.) and the large
ball (248° F.), the small crack (285° F.) and the large crack
(315° F.). When the last state is overreached, the sugar has
become caramel (360° F.).</p>

<p>Put the necessary quantity of loaf sugar in a small, copper
saucepan; moisten with enough water to melt it, and boil.
Carefully remove the scum which forms, and which might cause
the sugar to granulate.</p>

<p>As soon as the sugar begins to move stiffly in boiling, it
is a sign that the water has almost entirely evaporated, and that
the real cooking of the sugar has begun.</p>

<p>From this moment, with moistened fingers or a little piece
of moistened linen, take care to remove the crystallised sugar
from the sides of the utensil, lest it makes the remaining portion
turn.</p>

<p>The cooking of the sugar then progresses very rapidly, and
the states of its various stages, coming one upon the other in
quick succession at intervals of a few minutes, may be ascertained
as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>It has reached the <i>small-thread stage</i>, when a drop of it held
between the thumb and the first finger forms small resistless
strings when the thumb and finger are drawn apart.</p>

<p>It has reached the <i>large-thread stage</i>, when, proceeding in
the same way, the strings formed between the parted finger and
thumb are more numerous and stronger.</p>

<p>From this moment recourse must be had to cold water in
order to ascertain the states of the sugar.</p>

<p>When a few minutes have elapsed after the test for the large-thread
state, dip the end of the first finger, first into cold
water, then into the sugar, and plunge it again immediately
into the bowl of cold water, which should be ready at hand.
The sugar taken from the finger forms a kind of soft ball, and
it is this state which is called the <i>small ball</i>.</p>

<p>When, upon repeating the procedure, the sugar removed
from the finger rolls into a firmer ball, the <i>large-ball stage</i> is
reached.</p>

<p>After the cooking has continued for a few seconds longer,
the sugar lying on the finger peels off in the form of a thin,
flexible film, which sticks to the teeth. This is the <i>small-crack
stage</i>. Tests should then be made in quick succession, until
<a id="png.709" href="#png.709"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>691<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the film taken from the end of the finger breaks “clean” in
the teeth, like glass. This is the <i>large-crack state</i>, the last of
the cooking stages, and as soon as it has been reached the
utensil should be taken off the fire, lest a few seconds more
turn the sugar to <i>caramel</i>.</p>

<p>To prevent the granulating of the sugar, a few drops of
lemon juice may be added to it; or, better still, a tablespoonful
of glucose per lb.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2345—Glace à l’Ancienne"><a id="rcp.2345"
 >2345—GLACE <span class="nw">A L’ANCIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Put the required amount of icing sugar in a small saucepan,
the quantity used being in proportion to the object to be glazed.</p>

<p>If it be flavoured with vanilla, orange, or lemon, dilute it
with a little water, keeping it somewhat stiff; add some vanilla-flavoured
sugar or grated orange-rind, and stir it up well for
a few minutes. Then make it lukewarm, so that it may run
easily and dry quickly, and pour it over the object to be treated.</p>

<p>For the above-mentioned flavours, an infusion of vanilla
or orange-rind may be prepared, and this may serve in diluting
the glaze. The flavours may also be used in the form of
essences, provided it be remembered that they are usually very
strong thus, and must be used with caution.</p>

<p>If liqueur glazes are in question, such as Kirsch, Rum,
Anisette, or Marasquin, &amp;c., the glaze is diluted with the liqueur
and made lukewarm as directed above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2346—Glace au Fondant"><a id="rcp.2346"
 >2346—GLACE AU FONDANT</a></h3>

<p><i>Preparation of the “Fondant.”</i>—Put some loaf sugar into
a small saucepan, the quantity being in accordance with the
amount of “Fondant” required.</p>

<p>Moisten with just enough water to melt the sugar, and set
to cook as directed under “The Cooking of Sugar.”</p>

<p>Stop the cooking precisely at 230° F. between the <i><a href="#g_sugar">large-thread</a>
stage</i> and the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-ball</a> stage</i>, and pour the sugar on a
moderately-oiled marble slab. Let it half cool for a few
minutes; then, with a spatula, move it about well in all directions,
taking care that no portion of the sugar on the marble
is left untouched by the spatula, for any such portion would
harden and form lumps in the Fondant.</p>

<p>After ten to fifteen minutes’ work with the spatula, the sugar
should have become a white, slightly granulated paste. Heap
the latter together, and scrape the marble slab with the blade
of a strong knife. Carefully knead this paste (No. <a href="#rcp.2357">2357</a>) with
the palm of the hand until it is very thin and smooth, whereupon
the Fondant is ready for use.</p>

<p><a id="png.710" href="#png.710"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>692<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It need now only be heaped in a receptacle, covered with a
damp cloth, and kept somewhat dry.</p>

<p><i>To Glaze with “Fondant.”</i>—Put the required amount of it
into a saucepan; work it over a slow fire for a while, in order
to soften it, and moisten it, little by little, with water when
a dry flavour or an essence is used, or, otherwise, with the
selected liqueur.</p>

<p>Warm slightly in order to make the glaze very liquid and
to ensure its speedy drying, and pour it, at one tilt, over the
object to be glazed.</p>

<p>With the help of some colour, the glaze is generally given
the tint of the fruit which flavours it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2346a—Sucre en Glace (Icing Sugar)"><a id="rcp.2346a"
 >2346a—SUCRE EN GLACE (Icing Sugar)</a></h3>

<p>This is sugar strained through a silken drum-sieve. The
sugar strained through this silk has the delicacy of starch.
At times it is used instead of Fondant for the glazing of
cakes, but it is mostly used for white and caramel glazings.
For this purpose the sugar is held in a tin box, covered with
a lid pierced with small holes, called a sugar dredger.</p>

<p>To <i>glaze white</i> is to cover a cake, a fritter, or other object
with a coat of icing sugar. This operation is effected by shaking
the sugar dredger over the object to be glazed.</p>

<p><i>To glaze with caramel</i> is to cover a <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflé</a></i>, a <i>souffléd</i> omelet,
fruit fritters, a custard, <i><a href="#g_pannequets">Pannequets</a></i>, or other objects with a coat
of icing sugar. By placing the sugar-coated object in fierce
heat, a few minutes suffice to melt the sugar, which is converted
into a brilliant covering of caramel.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2347—Sugar Grains"><a id="rcp.2347"
 >2347—SUGAR GRAINS</a></h3>

<p>These are used in pastry to border certain cakes, or to surround
the sugared-paste bases on which cakes are set. For this
purpose the parts to which the sugar is expected to adhere
must be besmeared with cooked apricot.</p>

<p>To make them, roughly pound some loaf sugar, and sift the
latter first through a coarse strainer, and then through a finer
one, according to the size the sugar grains are required to be.
The powder will, of course, fall and leave the grains clean.</p>

<p>To colour sugar grains, spread them on a piece of paper,
and add a drop of liquid vegetable-colouring or a very little
coloured paste per tablespoonful of sugar. The amount of
colouring matter may either be lessened or increased, according
to the strength the shade is required to be.</p>

<p>Rub the sugar in the hand to colour it evenly; dry it in a
<a id="png.711" href="#png.711"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>693<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>moderately warm drying-box, and keep it in the dry in well-closed
boxes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2349—Vanilla Sugar"><a id="rcp.2349"
 >2349—VANILLA SUGAR</a></h3>

<p>The vanilla sticks which have served in preparing infusions
still possess some flavour. Reserve them, therefore, for the
making of vanilla sugar.</p>

<p>After having gently dried them in the drying-box, finely
pound them with twice their weight of loaf sugar; sift through
a silken sieve, and again pound the bits remaining on the silk
of the sieve until every particle goes through. Keep the preparation
in a well-closed box in the dry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2350—Candied Fruit"><a id="rcp.2350"
 >2350—CANDIED FRUIT</a></h3>

<p>These are used in the decoration of certain cakes, and as
the constituent ingredients of others.</p>

<p>They comprise angelica, golden and green <i><a href="#g_chinois">chinois</a></i>, cherries,
plums, red and white pears, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Candied fruit may be bought ready-prepared.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2351—Apple Jelly for Decorating"><a id="rcp.2351"
 >2351—APPLE JELLY FOR DECORATING</a></h3>

<p>Quarter, peel, and core the apples (preferably russets), and
throw them, one by one, in a bowl of fresh water to prevent
their getting brown.</p>

<p>Then put them in a copper basin with one and one-half pints
of water per two lbs. of apples, and cook them gently without
touching them.</p>

<p>This done, pour away their juice, and return it to the basin
together with two lbs. of sugar per quart. Boil; skim with
great care, that the jelly may be clear, and cook over a fierce
fire until the jelly has reached a stage which may be ascertained
<span class="nw">thus:—</span>(1) When on taking the skimmer out of the basin, the
jelly adhering to it seems to mass itself towards the middle
of the skimmer; <span class="nw">or:—</span>(2) When the jelly breaks up into large
drops, separated one from the other.</p>

<p>Then take the jelly off the fire; add some carmine to it,
drop by drop, until it acquires a rosy hue; strain it again
through a fine piece of linen, that it may be perfectly limpid,
and finally pour it into tin receptacles to cool.</p>

<p>Put aside until wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2352—Pralin" id="g_pralin"><a id="rcp.2352"
 >2352—PRALIN</a></h3>

<p>(1) If it be for the purpose of covering certain cakes, or for
forming a glaze on a fruit entremet, prepare it <span class="nw">thus:—</span>Put the
whites of two eggs and three tablespoonfuls of icing sugar in a
small basin. Mix and stir briskly with a small, wooden spoon,
until the paste becomes somewhat thick. Then, subject to the
<a id="png.712" href="#png.712"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>694<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>purpose for which it is intended, add a more or less large
quantity of chopped almonds, according as to whether the pralin
be required thick or slightly liquid for spreading. Cover it
with a piece of white paper, moistened with white of egg, that
it may remain moist if kept for some time.</p>

<p>(2) If it is to be added to a <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a></i> preparation, to a <i>souffléd</i>
omelet, to a preparation of ice, or to a custard, it is a nougat
powder which is prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Gently melt one lb. of powdered sugar in a small saucepan,
taking care not to let it acquire a deeper shade than old gold.
Mix twenty oz. of dried almonds with it; turn the whole out
on to the corner of a slightly-oiled marble slab (or on an overturned
saucepan-lid), and leave to cool. When the nougat is
quite cold, pound it and rub it through a sieve.</p>

<p>Pound and rub what remains in the sieve until the whole
goes through.</p>

<p>Put the powder in a well-closed box, and place the latter in
a dry place.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2353—Currants and Sultanas"><a id="rcp.2353"
 >2353—CURRANTS AND SULTANAS</a></h3>

<p>Sultanas and currants should always be at hand, ready and
cleaned. To clean them, first dredge them and then rub them
in a towel, closed to form a sort of purse. Now, turn them into
a sieve or colander, which shake vigorously, that the flour and
the detached stems may be eliminated; then examine them,
one by one, to make sure that no stems remain.</p>

<p>Currants should be examined with very particular care, as
small stones often get in among them.</p>

<p>Put the currants and the sultanas aside, each in a box or a
drawer.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2354—Essences and Flavourings"><a id="rcp.2354"
 >2354—ESSENCES AND FLAVOURINGS</a></h3>

<p>The various essences used in pastry are bought ready-made.
The flavourings consist of those products treated by infusion,
such as vanilla; of grated or infused products, such as lemon
and orange rinds; and liqueurs in general.</p>

<p>Fruit juices only become flavours when a liqueur in keeping
with the fruit from which they were extracted has been added
to them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2355—Gilding Preparation"><a id="rcp.2355"
 >2355—GILDING PREPARATION</a></h3>

<p>This consists of beaten eggs. Its purpose is to ensure the
colouration of certain cakes, whereon it is smeared by means
of a brush. In some cases this <a href="#g_gild">gilding</a> may be combined with
a little water, as, for instance, when the heat of the oven is too
<a id="png.713" href="#png.713"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>695<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fierce, and cakes are required of a light colour. In some cases,
especially in that of small, dry cakes, it consists entirely of
egg-yolks diluted with a few drops of water.</p>

<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2356—Ordinary Short Paste"><a id="rcp.2356"
 >2356—ORDINARY SHORT PASTE</a></h3>

<p>Sift one lb. of flour over the mixing-board; make a hollow
in its midst, and put therein one-sixth oz. of salt, one-third
pint of cold water, and one-half lb. of butter well softened—especially
in winter. Mix the flour gradually with the butter and
the water; mass the whole a moment or two, and knead it (see
No. <a href="#rcp.2357">2357</a>) twice. Then roll it up in a ball; wrap it in a piece
of linen that its surface may not dry, and put it aside in the
cool.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>: A kneaded paste should be prepared either one
day, or at least a few hours, in advance, in order that it may
lose that elasticity which it acquires from the kneading.</p>

<p>Pastes, after they have rested awhile, are much more easily
treated, and bake a much more definite and lighter colour, than
those that are used as soon as they are prepared.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2357—The Kneading of Pastes"><a id="rcp.2357"
 >2357—THE KNEADING OF PASTES</a></h3>

<p>The object of kneading paste is to combine the ingredients
of which it is composed thoroughly, and also to smooth it.
Proceed as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>When the paste is mixed, roll it into a mass; put it in front
of one; then press it away from one, little by little, between the
board and the palm of the hand. For the paste to be perfectly
smooth, it ought to be treated twice in this way.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2358—Fine, Short or Flawn Paste (For Fruit Tarts)"><a id="rcp.2358"
 >2358—FINE, SHORT OR FLAWN PASTE <span class="nw">(For Fruit Tarts)</span></a></h3>

<p>Sift one lb. of flour on to the mixing-board, and hollow it
out. Put in the hollow one-third oz. of salt, one and one-half oz. of powdered sugar, an egg, one-fourth pint of cold water,
and ten oz. of butter. First, thoroughly mix the butter, the
egg, the water, and the seasoning, and then gradually combine
the flour with it.</p>

<p>Knead the paste; press it out twice; roll it into a ball, and
wrap it up as before with the view of setting it aside in the cool
to rest.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2359—Dressing Paste (Pâte à Pâté)"><a id="rcp.2359"
 >2359—DRESSING PASTE <span class="nw">(Pâte à Pâté)</span></a></h3>

<p>Take one lb. of sifted flour, four oz. of butter, one egg, one-third oz. of salt, and one-fourth pint of water. Mix as already
<a id="png.714" href="#png.714"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>696<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>directed; knead twice; roll up the paste, and set it in the cool to
rest. This paste should be kept somewhat firm.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2360—Dressing Paste with Lard"><a id="rcp.2360"
 >2360—DRESSING PASTE WITH LARD</a></h3>

<p>Take one lb. of sifted flour, four oz. of lard, one-quarter pint
of tepid water, one egg, one-third oz. of salt, and proceed
exactly as in the case of No. <a href="#rcp.2359">2359</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2361—Dumpling and Pudding Pastes"><a id="rcp.2361"
 >2361—DUMPLING AND PUDDING PASTES</a></h3>

<p>Break up ten oz. of very dry beef suet, and carefully clear
it of all little pieces of skin and connective tissue. Chop it up
as finely as possible; sift one lb. of flour on to the mixing-board;
hollow it out; and put into the hollow one-half oz. of
salt, one and one-half oz. of sugar, one-third pint of water, and
the chopped suet. Mix up these various ingredients, and, by
degrees, combine the flour with them.</p>

<p>Mass the paste together, without kneading it, and put it aside
in the cool until it is wanted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2362—Dry Sugared Paste for Various Purposes"><a id="rcp.2362"
 >2362—DRY SUGARED PASTE FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES</a></h3>

<p>Take one lb. of sifted flour, seven oz. of butter, five oz. of
powdered sugar, three eggs, and one-half tablespoonful of
orange-flower water.</p>

<p>Mix in the usual way, knead it twice; roll it into a ball, and
keep it wrapped up, in the cool, until required.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2363—Paste for Small Gummed Tea-cakes"><a id="rcp.2363"
 >2363—PASTE FOR SMALL GUMMED TEA-CAKES</a></h3>

<p>Take one lb. of sifted flour, ten oz. of butter, ten oz. of
sugar, one egg, the yolks of four, and a tablespoonful of orange-flower
water.</p>

<p>Mix up gradually; mass the paste together, and roll it out
into a thin layer, twice. Roll it up, and let it rest awhile
in the cool before it is used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2364—Gumming"><a id="rcp.2364"
 >2364—GUMMING</a></h3>

<p>In the case of certain small cakes, especially those served at
tea, it is usual to gum their surfaces in order to make them
glossy. For this purpose a thin solution of gum arabic is used,
and it is smeared over the cakes as they leave the oven, by
means of a small brush.</p>

<p>Cakes may also be gummed with a syrup formed from milk
and sugar, which mixture may be used instead of gum arabic
with advantage.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2365—Galette Paste"><a id="rcp.2365"
 >2365—GALETTE PASTE</a></h3>

<p>Hollow out one lb. of sifted flour and put in its midst one-third oz. of salt, two oz. of powdered sugar, one-quarter pint of
water, and one-half lb. of softened butter.</p>

<p>Mix, taking care to include the flour only by degrees;
<a id="png.715" href="#png.715"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>697<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thoroughly knead, that the ingredients may be well combined,
and mass the paste together without making it too elastic.
Leave it to rest in the cool for at least an hour; then roll it
out thrice, at intervals of eight minutes, for the reasons given
under the directions for puff-paste.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2366—Puff-paste"><a id="rcp.2366"
 >2366—PUFF-PASTE</a></h3>

<p>(1) Sift one lb. of flour on to the mixing-board. Make a
hollow in it, and put therein one-third oz. of table salt and
about one-half pint of cold water, and mix without kneading.
Mass the paste together, and let it rest for twenty minutes, that
it may lose its elasticity, which will be all the more pronounced
for its having been very much worked. It is to avoid this
elasticity, therefore, that the mixing of puff-paste should be
effected with the smallest amount of kneading possible.</p>

<p>(2) Spread the prepared paste on a flour-dusted board, in the
shape of an even <a href="#g_galette">galette</a>. Spread thereon one lb. of softened
butter, without completely covering the paste; draw the edges
of the paste towards the centre, in such wise as to enclose the
butter completely, and to form a square thickness of paste.</p>

<p>(3) Leave to rest for a further ten minutes and then begin
the working of the paste; rolling it out to the length of one and
one-half feet, and keeping it one in. thick. Fold this layer over
thrice, and press upon it with the roller so as to join the superposed
layers. The whole of this operation constitutes one turn.</p>

<p>Begin another turn immediately, turning the paste the reverse
way, and folding it as before. Set it to rest in the cool for
eight or ten minutes, and then effect two more turns.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the two last turns (there should be six in
all), the puff-paste is ready to be cut up and used.</p>

<p><i>Remarks relative to puff-paste</i>: Good puff-paste should be
buttered to the extent of one lb. per one and one-half lbs., <i>i.e.</i>,
one lb. of butter for every one lb. of flour mixed with one-half
pint of water. The consistence of the paste and the butter
should be exactly the same, if they are to be evenly mixed; the
butter ought therefore to be softened—more particularly in
winter.</p>

<p>In preparing puff-paste, remember to put it in a cool place
while it is resting; but never directly upon ice; for, though the
ice would not affect the paste, it might seriously affect the butter.</p>

<p>It would harden it to the extent of preventing its perfect
mixture with the mass, and lumps would form. Puff-paste
should be rolled out very regularly, with the view of thoroughly
distributing the butter throughout the preparation, and thus
ensuring its uniform rising.</p>

<p>Puff-paste should not be worked too speedily; for, if it be so
<a id="png.716" href="#png.716"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>698<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>worked, it will be found to acquire an elasticity which not only
makes it difficult to cut up, but also tends to make it shrink in
the baking.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2367—Puff-paste Trimmings or Half Puff-paste"><a id="rcp.2367"
 >2367—PUFF-PASTE TRIMMINGS OR HALF PUFF-PASTE</a></h3>

<p>These are very useful in pastry work, for tartlets, <a href="#g_barquettes"><i>barquettes</i></a>,
<i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i>, &amp;c. When the puff-paste is cut up, the trimmings
should therefore be rolled into a ball, and put aside in the cool.
Nevertheless they must be used within the space of two days in
summer and four days in winter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2368—Ordinary Brioche Paste"><a id="rcp.2368"
 >2368—ORDINARY BRIOCHE PASTE</a></h3>

<p>(1) Sift one lb. of flour on to the board; take a quarter of it,
make a hollow in it, and put therein one-quarter oz. of very
fresh, dry yeast. Mix the yeast and the flour with a little tepid
water, so as to obtain a soft paste which is the leaven. Roll
this paste into a ball; make two slits in its top, at right angles
to one another, and place it in a small basin.</p>

<p>Cover the latter, and put it in a somewhat warm place, that
the leaven may be sure to ferment.</p>

<p>(2) Make a hollow in the remaining flour, and put into it one-quarter oz. of salt, and one and one-half oz. of sugar, together
with two tablespoonfuls of milk to melt it, one-third of the
whole amount of the butter to be used, namely, four oz., and
four eggs.</p>

<p>Begin by thoroughly mixing the butter, eggs and seasoning,
and then combine the flour therewith, by degrees. When the
paste forms a compact mass, knead and pull it about with the
hands, that it may be light. When, at the end of a few minutes,
it has acquired a certain resilience, make a hole in the middle
of it and add one egg. Mix the latter with the paste; work it
afresh, and after an interval of two minutes add one more egg in
the same way. The total number of eggs for the quantities
of other ingredients given above should be six.</p>

<p>(3) Add the remaining butter (eight oz.) to the paste; the
former being <i><a href="#g_manied">manied</a></i> and even softened, just sufficiently to make
it of the same consistence as the paste.</p>

<p>Spread it on the latter, and mix the two; kneading small
portions at a time, and combining those portions so as to mix
the two elements completely.</p>

<p>At this stage, overturn the paste and spread the leaven
(which should now be equal to twice its original bulk) upon it.</p>

<p>Mix it well as in the case of the butter, without working the
paste.</p>

<p><a id="png.717" href="#png.717"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>699<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Finally, put the paste into a basin; cover it, and place it in
a temperate room.</p>

<p>For it to have the desired lightness, this paste should ferment
for from ten to twelve hours. However, at the end of five
or six hours, the process is arrested by the working of the paste;
that is to say, by turning it out upon a flour-dusted board and
beating it with the palm of the hand.</p>

<p>It is then returned to the basin to ferment afresh, for five
or six hours; and then it is once more beaten just before being
used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2369—Mousseline Brioche Paste"><a id="rcp.2369"
 >2369—MOUSSELINE BRIOCHE PASTE</a></h3>

<p><i><a href="#g_mousseline">Mousseline</a></i> brioche paste is made from the ordinary kind,
combined with a little butter and developed in the mould by
fermentation before the baking process—which procedure makes
it exceedingly light and delicate.</p>

<p>This paste is used in the preparation of certain timbales for
fruit sweets, and it is prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Take the required amount of ordinary brioche paste, and
add to it, per lb. of paste, two oz. of best butter, softened to
the consistence of an ointment, that it may thoroughly mix
with the paste. Roll the paste into a ball, and put it in a
liberally-buttered mould, only filling two-thirds of the latter
with it. The remaining third of the mould gets filled by the
rising of the paste. Place the mould in a temperate room, until
the paste has risen to the edges of the mould; besmear the surface
of the paste with a brush dipped in melted butter, and bake
in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2370—Ordinary Brioche Paste"><a id="rcp.2370"
 >2370—ORDINARY BRIOCHE PASTE (For Rissoles, Small Patties à la Dauphine, and Various other Preparations)</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities</i>: one lb. of flour, seven oz. of butter, four fair-sized
eggs, salt, a pinch of powdered sugar; one-third oz. of
very dry, fresh yeast, and a little tepid milk.</p>

<p>(1) Make the leaven with a quarter of the flour, the yeast
and the lukewarm milk, and set it to ferment while the paste
is being prepared.</p>

<p>(2) Prepare the paste as already directed, and keep it fermenting
as before for ten hours, taking care to arrest the process
once.</p>

<p>The work is the same as in the preceding case, in every
particular, except in regard to the amount of butter, which in
this instance is only half as much; in regard to the amount
of sugar, which should only be just sufficient to ensure the
colouring of the paste; and finally in regard to its firmness,
which should admit of the paste being worked with a rolling-pin.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2371—Savarin Paste"><a id="png.718" href="#png.718"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>700<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2371"
 >2371—SAVARIN PASTE</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities</i>: One lb. of flour; twelve oz. of butter; one-half oz. of very dry, fresh yeast; eight eggs; about one-third pint of
milk; one-half oz. of salt, and one oz. of sugar.</p>

<p><i>Procedure</i>: Savarin paste may be prepared in several ways;
but the one given below is as simple and expeditious as could
be desired.</p>

<p>Sift the flour into a basin (or a round wooden bowl, better
suited to the work); hollow it out; add the yeast, and dissolve
the latter by means of tepid milk, stirring slightly with the tip
of the finger.</p>

<p>Add the eggs; mix the whole; work the paste by hand for
a few minutes; detach those portions of it which have adhered
to the side of the utensil, and add them to the whole.</p>

<p>Distribute the softened butter in small quantities over the
paste. Cover, and place in a temperate room until the paste has
grown to twice its original bulk. Then add salt; knead the
paste, that it may thoroughly absorb the butter, and pat it
briskly until it is sufficiently elastic to be taken up in one lump.</p>

<p>At this stage add the sugar, and work the paste again that
the former may thoroughly mix with it. The sugar should only
be added at the close of the operation; for, since it impairs the
cohesiveness of the paste, it would render the latter much more
difficult to work were it added at the start.</p>


<h4 class="subhead" title="The Uses of this Paste"><span class="allsc">THE USES OF THIS PASTE</span></h4>

<p>If it be for Savarins with syrup, it is customary to sprinkle
the previously-buttered moulds with slightly-grilled, chopped
or splintered almonds. Take the paste in small quantities at a
time, and line the moulds with it to the extent of one-third of
their height.</p>

<p>The remaining two-thirds of each mould become covered
when the paste rises owing to fermentation.</p>

<p>Proceed in the same way for Savarins which are to be kept
dry, for fruit crusts or other uses; but then the sprinkling of
the moulds with almond may be omitted.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2372—Pâte à Baba"><a id="rcp.2372"
 >2372—PÂTE A BABA</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities</i>: One lb. of flour; one-half lb. of butter; seven
eggs; two-thirds oz. of yeast; one-fifth pint of milk; one-third oz. of salt; two-thirds oz. of sugar; three oz. of currants and
sultanas in equal quantities.</p>

<p><i>Procedure</i>: Proceed exactly as for Savarin paste, and add the
currants and sultanas at the last with the sugar. In moulding,
<a id="png.719" href="#png.719"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>701<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a few pipped Malaga raisins may be laid on the bottom of the
moulds. As in the case of the Savarin, the paste should only
fill one-third of the mould.</p>

spoon, and the butter begins to ooze slightly.</p>

<p>Take the saucepan off the fire; add the eggs, two at a time,
taking care to mix each couple thoroughly with the paste before
inserting the succeeding couple. When all the eggs have been
absorbed, finish the paste with orange-flower water.</p>

<p>Put into a copper basin one lb. of powdered sugar and
sixteen eggs. Mix the two; place the basin upon hot cinders
or on the hob, and whisk its contents until they reach the
<i>“ribbon” stage</i> (see remarks below). Then add the selected
aroma (vanilla sugar, orange rind, or liqueur, in the proportion
of one tablespoonful of vanilla sugar or orange rind, and one
liqueur-glass of liqueur, to the quantities given above), twelve oz. of sifted flour, and eight oz. of melted butter, the latter being
carefully poured into the paste without allowing it to bubble.
Mix these ingredients with the paste, raising the latter by means

<h3 class="recipe" title="2377—Ordinary Génoise Paste for Cutting Up"><a id="rcp.2377"
 >2377—ORDINARY GÉNOISE PASTE FOR CUTTING UP</a></h3>

<p><i>Quantities.</i>—One lb. of sugar, twelve eggs, thirteen oz. of
flour, eight oz. of butter, and the quantity of flavouring thought
sufficient.</p>

<p>Proceed exactly as in the preceding recipe, in everything
pertaining to the working of the paste.</p>

<p>This paste is baked in buttered and dredged cases, in which
it is spread in layers one and one-quarter inches thick, that it
may rise to about one and three-quarter inches thick, while
baking.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2378—Lady’s-finger Biscuit Paste"><a id="rcp.2378"
 >2378—LADY’S-FINGER BISCUIT PASTE</a></h3>

<p>Stir one lb. of sugar and sixteen egg-yolks in a basin until
the preparation has whitened slightly and has reached the
<a href="#g_ribbon"><i>ribbon</i></a> stage. Now add a tablespoonful of orange-flower water;
mix therewith twelve oz. of sifted flour, followed by sixteen
egg-whites, whisked to a stiff froth. Take care to effect the
mixture by raising and cutting the preparation with the spatula,
that the former may be quite light.</p>

<p><i>To Shape the Biscuits.</i>—Put the paste, little by little, into
a canvas piping-bag, fitted with a pipe of one-half inch bore.
Close the bag; lay the biscuits on sheets of strong paper;
sprinkle them with powdered sugar, and rid them of any superfluous
sugar by holding the sheets end upwards.</p>

<p>Jerk a few drops of water upon the biscuits by means of
a moistened brush in order to assist the beading of the sugar,
and remember that a very moderate oven is the best for the
effecting of this beading.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2379—Savoy-biscuit Paste"><a id="rcp.2379"

sugar; add six oz. of very dry, sifted flour mixed with six oz.
of fecula, and finally mix therewith the fourteen egg-whites,
which should be in a very stiff froth.</p>

<p>Carefully set the preparation in buttered and fecula-dredged

<p>Cook one lb. of sugar to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">large-ball</a></i> stage, and meanwhile
whisk the whites of eight eggs to a stiff froth, so as to have
them ready simultaneously with the sugar.</p>

<p>Pour the cooked sugar into the egg-whites, slowly and without
a pause, and mix up briskly with the whisk.</p>

<p>Mix one lb. of very best powdered sugar and the whites of
eight eggs in an untinned copper basin. Place the utensil on
hot cinders or on the side of the stove, that the preparation may
be lukewarm while in progress.</p>

<p>Whisk the meringue until it is sufficiently consistent to span
the members of the whisk. If it is not to be used at once,
transfer the paste to a small basin; cover it with a round piece
of paper, and set it in the cool.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2385—Almond Paste"><a id="rcp.2385"
 >2385—ALMOND PASTE</a></h3>

<p>Instead of the antiquated and difficult method of making

<a id="png.722" href="#png.722"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>704<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which not only yields a much smoother paste, but also greatly
simplifies the work. Almond paste, which consists of almonds,
sugar, and egg-whites, in quantities varying in accordance with
the purpose of the paste, is now sold ready-made. It has only
to be finished with a little sugar, white of egg, and other
things, subject to the use to which it is to be put.</p>

<p>Pass eight oz. of dry, skinned almonds through the crusher.<!-- TN: period invisible --></p>

<p>Place them in the mortar, together with the selected aromatic
essence; either a tablespoonful of vanilla sugar or a small
glassful of liqueur; and add to them, little by little, working the
while with the pestle, one lb. of sugar cooked to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a></i>

<p>With this generic recipe, the melting paste may be varied
at will by an increase or decrease in the quantity of sugar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2387—Pistachios"><a id="rcp.2387"
 >2387—PISTACHIOS</a></h3>

<p>These should belong to the pastry-cook’s stock, but, as a

them, proceed as in the case of almonds.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2388—Pistachio Paste for Infusion"><a id="rcp.2388"
 >2388—PISTACHIO PASTE FOR INFUSION</a></h3>

<p>As soon as the pistachios are skinned, washed, and dried,
crush them in the mortar to a very smooth paste, which set in
boiled milk, to infuse.</p>

<p>As the colour of pistachios is weak, it is strengthened in
preparations containing them with a few drops of vegetable
green, while its aroma is thrown into relief with a trifle of
vanilla.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2389—Melting Pistachio Paste"><a id="rcp.2389"
 >2389—MELTING PISTACHIO PASTE</a></h3>

<p>Put seven oz. of pistachios and two oz. of almonds through

paste into the mortar; add to it two tablespoonfuls of syrup,
strongly flavoured with vanilla, followed by eight oz. of sugar,
cooked to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a></i> stage, and added to the paste little
by little.</p>

<p>Transfer the paste to a marble slab, and finish it by combining
three tablespoonfuls of icing sugar with it.</p>

 </span></span></a>thereon an overturned plate or a saucepan-lid, the size of which
should be that intended for the Vol-au-vent, and cut the paste
obliquely, following round the edges of the lid or plate with a
small knife. Turn the layer of paste over, and set it on a
slightly moistened round baking sheet; groove it all round;
<i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> it, and describe a circle on top of it with the point of a
knife, one and one-quarter inches away from the edge, to form
the cover of the Vol-au-vent. Streak this cover criss-cross-fashion;
also streak the body of the Vol-au-vent with the point
of a small knife, and bake it in a rather hot oven.</p>

<p>Upon withdrawing the Vol-au-vent from the oven, remove
its cover, and clear it of the soft crumb which will be found on
its inside.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2391—Bouchée or Small-patty Crusts"><a id="rcp.2391"
 >2391—BOUCHEE OR SMALL-PATTY CRUSTS</a></h3>

<p>Bouchées are really small Vol-au-vents. Roll out the paste,
making it a good one-third inch thick. Cut this layer with a
grooved round cutter three inches in diameter; set the roundels
of stamped-out paste on a moistened tray; <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i>, and make a
circular incision in each of them, one-half inch from their edges,
either with the point of a small knife or with an even, round
cutter dipped in hot water.</p>

<p>Bake in a hot oven, and clear the insides of the bouchées of
their crumb on taking them out of the oven. “Mignonnes
Bouchées,” which are used as a garnish, are stamped out with
a round cutter two inches in diameter, and are slightly thicker
than ordinary bouchées.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2392—Small Hot Patties"><a id="rcp.2392"
 >2392—SMALL HOT PATTIES</a></h3>

<p>Roll out the puff-paste to a thickness of one-sixth inch, and
stamp it out with an even round cutter three inches in diameter.
With the trimmings resulting from this operation, rolled somewhat
more thinly, make an equal quantity of roundels, and lay
them on a tray. Slightly moisten the edges of these roundels
with a brush; garnish their centres with some forcemeat, rolled
to the size of a hazel-nut; cover the forcemeat with the roundels
stamped out from the first; press upon these with the back of
a round cutter two inches in diameter; <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> them, and bake
them in a hot oven for twelve or fourteen minutes.</p>

<p>For tartlet crusts, which are put to various uses, take either
even or grooved, large or small moulds, subject to the requirements.</p>

<p>Roll out a piece of short paste to a thickness of one-fifth inch;
stamp it out with a grooved round cutter of a size in proportion
to the moulds used; line the buttered moulds with these roundels
<a id="png.724" href="#png.724"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>706<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of paste; pierce the paste on the bottom of each with the point
of a small knife; line with good-quality paper; fill up with
lentils, split peas, or rice, and bake in a moderate oven. When
the paste is baked, withdraw the dry vegetable used and the
paper, and place the crusts in the drying-box, that they may
be quite dry; or <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> them inside, and set them in the front of
the oven for a few minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2394—Timbale Crust"><a id="rcp.2394"
 >2394—TIMBALE CRUST</a></h3>

<p>Butter a Charlotte-mould, and decorate its sides with some
sort of design made from noodle-paste trimmings to which a
little powdered sugar has been added. Shape a piece of short
paste (of a size in proportion to the mould) like a ball; roll it
out to a disc; sprinkle it with flour, and fold it in two. Draw
the ends gently towards the centre, so as to form a kind of
skullcap, and take care to not crease the paste. Make this
skullcap of an even thickness of one-third inch, and place it in
the mould.</p>

<p>Press it well upon the bottom and sides of the mould, that
it may acquire the shape of the latter; line the mould inside
with good buttered paper; fill up with lentils or split peas,
letting them project in a dome above the edges of the paste, and
cover with a round sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Prepare a round layer of paste, one-fifth inch thick, a little
larger diametrally than the timbale one. Slightly moisten the
inside edges of the timbale; cover it with the prepared disc of
paste, and seal it well down to the edges of the timbale, pressing
it between the fingers in such wise as to form a crest reaching
one-half inch beyond the brim of the mould all round.</p>

<p>Pinch this crest with paste-pincers inside and out.</p>

<p>With a round or oval grooved fancy-cutter stamp out some
imitation leaves from a very thin layer of paste, and imitate
the veins of the leaves with the back of a knife; or stamp
out some triangles of paste; shape them like leaves, and set
these (slightly overlapping one another) upon the dome of the
timbale in superposed rows.</p>

<p>Finish with three roundels of paste, stamped out with a
grooved round cutter of a different size from the first, and make
a hole in the centre of each roundel with a round, even fancy-cutter.
<i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i> and bake in a moderate oven. When the outside
of the timbale is well browned, detach and remove the cover
formed by the leaves. Withdraw the split peas and the paper;
<i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> the timbale inside, and leave it to dry in the front of the
oven or in the drying-box.</p>

 >2395—FLAWN CRUST</a></h3>

<p>With short or any other kind of paste prepare a layer one-sixth
inch thick, the diameter of which should be one-fourth as
long again as that of the flawn-ring used. Raise this layer, and
place it upon the previously-buttered flawn-ring, pressing it with
the fingers, that it may assume the shape of the mould. Then
roll the pin across the ring, in order that the overlapping paste
may be cut away; press the thickness of paste that has been
formed between the fingers in such a way as to make it project
above the edges of the flawn-ring, and form a regular crest.
Pinch this crest with the pastry pincers, and set the flawn-ring
on a small round baking sheet.</p>

<p>Prick it with the point of a small knife; line its bottom and
sides with slightly-buttered, good paper; fill the ring with dry
lentils or split peas, and bake in a moderately hot oven for
about twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Then remove the lentils and paper, as also the ring, and
return the flawn to the oven for a few minutes to brown, if it
is not already sufficiently coloured.</p>

<p>If the paste be required very dry, place the flawn in the
drying-box for a little while, or <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> it inside, and set it in the
front of the oven for a few minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2396—The Lining and Covering of Raised and Dressed Pies"><a id="rcp.2396"
 >2396—THE LINING AND COVERING OF RAISED AND DRESSED PIES</a></h3>

<p>The moulds for Raised Pies are oval or round. If they are
round, make a layer of patty paste, one-half inch thick, in proportion
to the size of the mould.</p>

<p>Sprinkle this paste with flour, fold it in two, and shape it
like a skullcap, after the manner described under “Timbale
Crust.” It is only necessary to press this skullcap of paste
into the buttered mould in order to give it the shape of the
latter. If the mould is oval, proceed in the same way, giving
the skullcap an oval shape.</p>

<p>When the raised pie is filled, first cover the garnish with
a somewhat thin, round, or oval layer of paste, in accordance
with the shape of the mould, and seal it well down upon the
moistened edges. Then cut away the superfluous paste of the
crest, so as to make the latter even and neat, and pinch it outside
and in. Raised pies are covered in two ways—either
with a layer of puff-paste, or with leaves of paste stamped
out with a round cutter or a knife, the veins being imitated
with the back of a knife.</p>

<p>In the first case, prepare a layer of puff-paste one-third inch
thick, equal in size to the inside of the patty. Drop this layer
<a id="png.726" href="#png.726"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>708<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of paste upon the cover of the pie, after having slightly moistened
it; <i><a href="#g_gild">gild</a></i> and streak it, and make a slit in the top for the
escape of steam.</p>

<p>In the second case, prepare the paste leaves as directed above,
and lay them on the pie (slightly overlapping one another) in
superposed rows, starting from the bottom. On the top of the
pie set three or four indented roundels of paste, graduated in
size, and stuck one upon the other, each roundel having a hole
in its centre for the escape of steam.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_gild">Gild</a></i> and set the pie in the oven.</p>

<p>The baking of raised pies made with raw forcemeat is effected
in a moderately-heated oven. Bear in mind that the larger the
pie is, the more moderate should be the oven.</p>


<h3 title="Various Custards">VARIOUS CUSTARDS</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="subhead" title="Hot Custards">Hot Custards</h3>
<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2397—Crème Anglaise"><a id="rcp.2397"
 >2397—CRÈME ANGLAISE</a></h3>

<p>This custard allows of various methods of preparation which
are subject to the purpose for which it is intended. It is the
chief sauce for entremets, and whether it be poached in a deep
dish or in a mould, it constitutes one of the oldest and best-known
entremets. This last kind of custard will be examined
hereafter. At present I shall only deal with the variety
used either as a sauce or an accompaniment, cold or hot. It
is extremely difficult to prescribe fixed quantities for this
custard, for the former depend a great deal upon the consumers’
tastes, and, whereas some like a thick custard, others go to the
extreme of wishing it just liquid enough to be drunk like any
other beverage.</p>

<p>The quantities given below are suited to a custard of medium
consistence, but if a thicker custard were desired, the number
of egg-yolks would have to be proportionately increased, and
<i>vice-versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The quantity of sugar also varies, subject to the consumers’
tastes, and, as the amount used (except in the case of unreasonable
excess) does not affect the consistence of the custard, it
may be graduated from three to ten or twelve oz. per quart, as
taste may dictate. Six oz. of sugar per quart of milk constitutes
a happy medium.</p>

<p>English custard admits of all the aromatic essences used for
entremets, but the one which suits it best is vanilla. When this
last-named flavour or that of filberts, almond <a href="#g_pralin">pralin</a>, or coffee
is used, it is well to put the required quantity to infuse for
<a id="png.727" href="#png.727"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>709<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>twenty minutes in the boiling milk, after the latter has been
measured off. Chocolate is first melted and then gradually
added to the custard before it is cooked. Other aromatic essences
or liqueurs are added to the custard after it has been strained.</p>

<p>English custard admits of two methods of <span class="nw">preparation:—</span></p>

<p><i>Recipe A.</i>—Put twelve raw egg-yolks and three-quarters lb.
of powdered sugar in a bowl. Mix the sugar a little with the
yolks, and stir the latter briskly with a spatula until they have
entirely absorbed the sugar, and the resulting paste is white
and has reached the <a href="#g_ribbon"><i>ribbon</i></a> stage. Then pour one quart of
boiling milk into the paste, little by little, mixing the whole
the while with a whisk. Then put the preparation on the fire,
stirring it with a spatula, and cook it until it approaches the
boil and properly coats the withdrawn spoon. Take care not
to let it boil, for this would turn the preparation. In any
case, when the sauce is intended for hot sweets, by adding a
tablespoonful of arrowroot, it may be prevented from turning.</p>

<p>When the custard is cooked, as already explained, strain it,
either through a strainer, into a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, if it is to be served
hot, or through a sieve into a large, enamelled basin, where
it should be frequently stirred to be kept smooth while cooling.</p>

<p>Custard prepared in this way forms the base of all ice-creams,
of which I shall speak later on. It may serve as an
adjunct to all cold or hot sweets which allow of a sauce. When,
while it is still lukewarm, it is combined with its weight of best
butter, it constitutes the delicious butter cream, which is the
richest and most delicate of the pastry-cook’s confections.</p>

<p>Finally, if eight melted gelatine leaves per quart of cooled
milk be added to it, and it be mixed with twice its volume of
whipped cream, it represents the preparation for “Cream
Bavarois” and “Russian Charlottes.”</p>

<p><i>Recipe B.</i>—Melt six oz. of sugar in one quart of milk; boil,
and pour the mixture, little by little, over twelve egg-yolks,
whisking the latter briskly the while. When this custard is to
be moulded, or is intended for a Cabinet Pudding, or some other
similar preparation, which must be ultimately poached, strain
it as soon as it is mixed, without cooking it.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, it be intended for an accompaniment,
or for the preparation of butter creams or ices, cook it as directed
in Recipe A.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2398—Dished English Custard (to Accompany Cold or Hot Stewed Fruit)"><a id="rcp.2398"
 >2398—DISHED ENGLISH CUSTARD <span class="nw">(To Accompany Cold or Hot Stewed Fruit)</span></a></h3>

<p>For this purpose English custard is made from only ten egg-yolks
per quart of milk. Serve it in shallow silver or porcelain
<a id="png.728" href="#png.728"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>710<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dishes; sprinkle its surface copiously with icing sugar, and
criss-cross it with a red-hot iron.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2399—Frangipan Cream"><a id="rcp.2399"
 >2399—FRANGIPAN CREAM</a></h3>

<p>As in the case of English custard, Frangipan custard varies
in the quantities of its ingredients in accordance with its purpose
and the taste of its consumers. The recipe given below is
an average one, which the reader will be able to modify, in
regard to consistence, by increasing or decreasing the amount of
flour.</p>

<p>Mix one-half lb. of powdered sugar, two oz. of flour, two
whole eggs, and the yolks of five in a basin. Pour one pint of
boiling milk over this paste, stirring it briskly the while; add
a grain of salt and the selected aromatic essence, and set the
saucepan on the fire, that the Frangipan may cook. Do not
cease stirring this cream while it is cooking, for it easily
burns.</p>

<p>Let it boil a few minutes; pour it into a bowl, and combine
three oz. of fresh butter and two tablespoonfuls of dry, crushed
macaroons with it. When the whole is well mixed, smooth
the surface of the custard with a well-buttered spoon, so that no
crust may form while the cooling progresses.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2400—Frangipan for Fried Cream"><a id="rcp.2400"
 >2400—FRANGIPAN FOR FRIED CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Proceed as above, but so apportion the quantities as to
obtain a very firm cream. The quantities should be as
<span class="nw">follows:—</span>Six oz. of flour, six oz. of sugar, ten egg-yolks, four
whole eggs, one quart of milk, and one oz. of butter.</p>

<p>When this cream is cooked, spread it in a layer one inch
thick on a buttered tray or on a marble slab; carefully butter
its surface, and let it cool before using it.</p>

<div class="ns"> </div>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2401—Pastry Cream"><a id="rcp.2401"
 >2401—PASTRY CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Mix one lb. of powdered sugar with four oz. of flour and
twelve egg-yolks, and dilute with one quart of boiling milk.
Cook this cream, stirring it continually the while; and, as soon
as it boils, add to it a few drops of orange-flower water and
four gelatine leaves, softened in cold water. Boil the cream
a few minutes; take it off the fire, and, while stirring it briskly,
carefully combine with it twelve egg-whites, beaten to a stiff
froth.</p>

<p>N.B.—Some operators call this St. Honoré cream (for, as
a matter of fact, it serves chiefly in the garnishing of sweets
bearing that name), and give the name of Pastry cream to the
<a id="png.729" href="#png.729"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>711<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>same preparation minus the egg-whites and the gelatine. I
prefer to abide by the principle given above, and to consider
the cream without whisked egg-whites merely as a Frangipan,
with which it has many points in common.</p>

<p>Pastry cream may be flavoured according to fancy. The
addition of the gelatine is not necessary when the cream is to
be served immediately, or when it only has a moment or two
to wait. But it is indispensable to prevent the decomposition
of the preparation, especially in hot weather, if it have to wait
at all.</p>

fresh for twenty-four hours in ice) over ice. The cream speedily
increases in volume and becomes frothy. The operation should
then be stopped, lest the cream turn to butter, and there should
be immediately added to the former four oz. of powdered sugar
(part of which should be the vanilla kind) per quart, and then
the preparation should be placed in the cool until required.</p>

<p>N.B.—The addition of a little dissolved or powdered tragacanth
gum to the cream allows of a more frothy cream being
obtained, but the result is neither as fresh nor as perfect in
taste when it is not combined with a sweet or ice preparation.</p>

 >2403—PREPARATIONS FOR PANCAKES AND PANNEQUETS</a></h3>

<p><i>Preparation A.</i>—Put into a basin one lb. of sifted flour, six oz.
of powdered sugar, and a pinch of table-salt. Dilute with ten
eggs and one quart of milk, added by degrees. Flavour with one
heaped tablespoonful of orange, lemon or vanilla sugar, which
should form part of the total weight of sugar prescribed; or with
one-eighth pint of some liqueur such as brandy, kirsch, rum, &amp;c.,
which should form part of the total moistening.</p>

<p><i>Preparation B.</i>—Dilute one lb. of flour, three and one-half oz.
of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt, with nine eggs and a half-pint
of cream. Add one-eighth pint of brandy, two and a half-oz.
of melted butter and one and a half-pints of milk. Pass the
whole through a fine strainer, and finish it with one-eighth pint of
<a href="#g_orgeat"><i>orgeat</i></a> syrup (or almond milk) and three oz. of finely-crushed
macaroons.</p>

<p><i>Preparation C.</i>—Dilute one lb. of flour, three and a half oz. of
powdered sugar and a pinch of table salt in nine eggs. Stir the
<a id="png.730" href="#png.730"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>712<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mixture well; add to it a half-pint of raw cream and one pint of
milk. Finish with a half-pint of whipped cream, and flavour as
fancy may suggest.</p>

<p><i>Preparation D.</i>—Dilute one lb. of flour, three and a half oz. of
powdered sugar and a pinch of salt, in five eggs and the yolks of
three. Add one and three-quarter pints of milk and five egg-whites
whisked to a stiff froth.</p>

<p>Flavour according to fancy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2404—Rice Preparation for Entremets"><a id="rcp.2404"
 >2404—RICE PREPARATION FOR ENTREMETS</a></h3>

<p>Wash one lb. of Carolina or Patna rice; cover it with plenty of
cold water; boil, and drain it the moment it has boiled. Wash it
once more in lukewarm water; drain it, and set it to cook with
two pints of boiled milk, two-thirds lb. of sugar, a pinch of salt
and three oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Flavour with a stick of vanilla or a few strips of orange or
lemon rind, strung together with cotton. When the liquor begins
to boil, cover the saucepan; place it in the oven, and let it cook
gently for twenty or twenty-five minutes, without once touching
the rice the while.</p>

<p>On withdrawing it from the oven, thicken it with the yolks of
sixteen eggs, which should be mixed with it by means of a fork
in such wise as not to break the rice grains, which ought to
remain whole.</p>

<p>N.B.—In some cases, the milk and the sugar may be replaced
(for the cooking process) by an equal amount of syrup at
12° (Saccharometer).</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2405—Soufflé Preparations"><a id="rcp.2405"
 >2405—SOUFFLÉ PREPARATIONS</a></h3>

<p><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflé</a> preparations are of two <span class="nw">kinds:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Those prepared with cream, which if necessary may serve
for all <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i>; (2) those with a fruit-purée base, which allow of
a more pronounced flavour for fruit <i><a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a></i> than if these were
prepared with cream.</p>

<p><i>Cream-soufflé Preparation for Four People.</i>—Boil one-sixth pint
of milk with one oz. of sugar; add a tablespoonful of flour
diluted in a little cold milk; cook for two minutes, and finish,
away from the fire, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and
two egg-yolks with three whites whisked to a stiff froth.</p>

<p><i>Soufflé Preparation for a Big Party.</i>—Thoroughly mix half-lb.
of flour, half-lb. of sugar, four eggs and the yolks of three, in a
saucepan. Dilute with one quart of boiling milk; add a stick of
vanilla; boil, and cook for two minutes, stirring incessantly
the while.</p>

<p><a id="png.731" href="#png.731"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>713<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Finish, away from the fire, with four oz. of butter, five egg-yolks,
and twelve whites, whisked to a very stiff froth.</p>

<p><i>Soufflé Preparation with a Fruit Base.</i>—Take one lb. of sugar
cooked to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a></i> stage; add thereto one lb. of the pulp
or purée of the fruit under treatment, and ten egg-whites, beaten
to a stiff froth.</p>

<p>Proceed thus: Having cooked the sugar to the extent stated
above, add to it the fruit pulp. If the latter reduces the sugar
a stage or two, cook it afresh in order to return it to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a></i>
stage; and, when this is reached, pour it over the whites.</p>

<p><i>Dishing and Cooking of Soufflés.</i>—Whatever the <a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a> may
consist of, dish them in a timbale, or in a special false-bottomed
dish, buttered and sugared inside. Cook in a somewhat moderate
oven, that the heat may reach the centre of the <a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a> by degrees.</p>

<p>Two minutes before withdrawing the <a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a> from the oven,
sprinkle it with icing sugar, which, when it becomes caramel
upon the surface of the <a href="#g_souffle">soufflé</a>, constitutes the glazing.</p>

<p>The decoration of <a href="#g_souffle">soufflés</a> is optional, and, in any case, should
not be overdone.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2408—Sabayon"><a id="rcp.2408"
 >2408—SABAYON</a></h3>

<p>Mix one lb. of powdered sugar with twelve egg-yolks, in a
basin, until the mixture has whitened slightly. Dilute with one
quart of dry, white wine; pour the whole in a narrow <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>,
which should be placed in a receptacle containing boiling water,
and whisk it until it is four times its former size, and is firm
and frothy.</p>

<p>N.B.—Sabayon may also be made with milk instead of white
wine, and it may be flavoured according to fancy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2409—Fruit Sauce"><a id="rcp.2409"
 >2409—FRUIT SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Apricots, red-currants, greengages and mirabelle plums are the
best fruits for sweet sauces. Other fruits, such as peaches, William
<a id="png.732" href="#png.732"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>714<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pears, apples, &amp;c., may also be used in the form of light purées
or cullises.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2410—Apricot Sauce"><a id="rcp.2410"
 >2410—APRICOT SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Rub some very ripe or stewed apricots through a sieve, and thin
the purée with the required quantity of syrup at 28° (Saccharom.).
Boil, skimming carefully the while; take off the fire when the
sauce veneers the withdrawn spoon, and flavour according to fancy.</p>

<p>If this sauce is to be used with crusts, a little best butter may
be added to it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2411—Red-currant Sauce"><a id="rcp.2411"
 >2411—RED-CURRANT SAUCE</a></h3>

<p>Melt some red-currant jelly and flavour it with kirsch.</p>

<p>This sauce may be slightly thickened with arrowroot.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2412—Sauce Orange"><a id="rcp.2412"

 >2418—THICKENED SYRUPS</a></h3>

<p>These accompaniments of sweets, which are commonly used in
Germany, have this in their favour, that they are economical; but
they should be used in moderation. To make them, take some
syrup at 15°, thickened with arrowroot, coloured according
to the purpose for which it is required, and flavoured with some
liqueur or essence at the last moment.</p>

<p>It is with this kind of sauce that flawns and all other sorts of
tartlets are coated in northern countries.</p>

<p>The numerous fritter recipes for sweets may all be grouped into
five leading classes, <span class="nw">viz.:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Fruit fritters.</p>

<p>(2) Custard fritters.</p>

<p>(3) Viennese fritters.</p>

<p>(4) Souffléd fritters.</p>

<p>(5) Sundry other fritters which are more or less like the four
former ones without entirely resembling them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2419—Class 1. Fresh Fruit and Flower Fritters"><a id="rcp.2419"
 >2419—<i>Class 1.</i> FRESH FRUIT AND FLOWER FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Subject to the treatment undergone by them, fruits for fritters
are of two kinds: firm fruits, such as apples and pears, and aqueous
fruits, such as strawberries, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2420—Fritters of Fruit with Firm Pulps"><a id="rcp.2420"
 >2420<!-- TN: original reads "420" -->—FRITTERS OF FRUIT WITH FIRM PULPS <span class="nw"><i>Ex.</i> APRICOT FRITTERS</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some apricots that are not over-ripe; cut them in two;
sprinkle them with sugar, and set them to macerate for an hour
in kirsch, brandy, or rum, subject to the consumers’ tastes. A few
minutes before serving, dry the halved apricots, dip them in batter
(No. <a href="#rcp.234">234</a>), and fry them in hot fat. Drain them on a napkin; set
the fritters on a tray; cover them with icing sugar, and glaze them
in a hot oven or at the salamander. Dish them on a napkin, and
serve them at once.</p>

<p>N.B.—Proceed in precisely the same way for Apple, Pear, Peach,
or Banana fritters.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2421—Aqueous-fruit Fritters"><a id="rcp.2421"
 >2421—AQUEOUS-FRUIT FRITTERS <span class="nw"><i>Ex.</i> STRAWBERRY FRITTERS</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some large, somewhat firm strawberries; sugar them
copiously; sprinkle them with kirsch, and let them macerate on
ice for thirty minutes.</p>

<p>It is most essential that the strawberries be well sugared before
macerating, because the heat of the fat sours them while the fritters
are being fried, and they consequently become tart.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, drain the strawberries, dip them
in batter (No. <a href="#rcp.234">234</a>), and plunge them into very hot fat. Drain them,
dish them on lace paper, and sprinkle them with icing sugar, by
means of a dredger.</p>

<p><a id="png.734" href="#png.734"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>716<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>N.B.—The procedure is the same for Raspberry, Red-currant,
Cherry, Orange, and Tangerine fritters. For the last-named, it is
better to quarter them and peel them raw, than to slice them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2422—Flower Fritters"><a id="rcp.2422"
 >2422—FLOWER FRITTERS. <span class="nw"><i>Ex.</i> ACACIA-FLOWER FRITTERS</span></a></h3>

<p>Select some blown acacia flowers; besprinkle them with sugar
and liqueur brandy, and leave them to macerate for thirty
minutes.</p>

<p>Dip them in batter (No. <a href="#rcp.234">234</a>); plunge them into plenty of hot
fat; drain them; sprinkle them with best sugar and dish them
on a napkin.</p>

<p>N.B.—Proceed as above for Elder-flower, Lily, and Vegetable-marrow-flower
fritters; but in the case of the last two, the
quartered corollæ, alone, are used.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2423—Custard Fritters or Fried Cream"><a id="rcp.2423"
 >2423—CUSTARD FRITTERS OR FRIED CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Custard fritters may be prepared in the three following totally
different ways.</p>

<p><i>1st Method.</i>—Cut up preparation No. <a href="#rcp.2400">2400</a> with a round, square, or
lozenge-shaped fancy cutter, as taste may dictate. Treat the resulting
pieces of custard twice <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, using very fine and fresh bread-crumbs
for the purpose. Press upon the bread-crumbs with the
blade of a knife that they may adhere properly, and fry the pieces
of cream in very hot fat. On taking the fritters out of the fat
sprinkle them with icing sugar, and dish them on a napkin.</p>

<p>N.B.—Instead of treating these fritters <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>, they may be
dipped into batter and treated as directed in the case of Apricot
fritters.</p>

<p><i>2nd Method.</i>—Prepare a custard as for a “crème renversée”
(No. <a href="#rcp.2639">2639</a>), using only whole eggs, that it may be firm; and poach
it in a utensil of a shape which will facilitate the cutting-up of the
preparation. When the latter is quite cool, cut it up as fancy may
suggest; dip the pieces in batter (No. <a href="#rcp.234">234</a>) and plunge them in
plenty of hot fat. Drain them on a piece of linen; sprinkle them
with icing sugar; glaze them in a fierce oven, and dish them on a
napkin.</p>

<p><i>3rd Method.</i>—Prepare some common-shaped <a href="#g_meringue">meringues</a>, and
keep them very dry.</p>

<p>When they have cooled, open them slightly on top, and, through
the hole in each, fill them either with a Bavarois preparation, with
some kind of ice-cream, or with a fruit <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> thickened with
stewed apricots or plums. Close the holes with the pieces that
were cut out, and place the <a href="#g_meringue">meringues</a> in the refrigerator for
an hour.</p>

<p><a id="png.735" href="#png.735"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>717<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>When about to serve them, quickly treat them <a href="#g_anglaise_1"><i>à l’anglaise</i></a>; set
them (opened side uppermost) in a frying-basket, and dip them for a
few seconds in smoking fat. Withdraw them as soon as their crusts
have acquired a golden colour; sprinkle them with icing sugar;
dish them on a napkin, and serve them immediately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2424—Viennese Fritters"><a id="rcp.2424"
 >2424—VIENNESE FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Quantities for the paste of Viennese fritters: one lb. of flour;
six oz. of butter; half oz. of yeast; five eggs; half oz. of salt;
two-third oz. of sugar; and one-sixth pint of milk. This paste is
prepared exactly like Brioche paste (No. <a href="#rcp.2368">2368</a>).</p>

<p>In any case, as it has to be worked with the rolling-pin, always
keep it a little firm.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2425—Hot Viennese Fritters"><a id="rcp.2425"
 >2425—HOT VIENNESE FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Roll out a piece of the paste given above to a thickness of
one-fifth inch.</p>

<p>Spread upon it, at regular intervals, small quantities (about the
size of a large walnut) either of stewed fruit or jam. Moisten
slightly; cover with a second layer of paste, of the same size and
thickness as the former; press upon it with the back of a round
cutter, so as to ensure the joining of the two layers of paste, and
then stamp the whole out with an even cutter two and a half inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>Set the fritters on a tray covered with a flour-dusted piece of
linen; let the paste ferment for thirty minutes, and then fry them
in plenty of hot fat. Drain them; sprinkle them with icing sugar
and dish them on a napkin.</p>

<p>N.B.—These fritters may be accompanied by frothy sauces,
flavoured with vanilla, lemon, orange, coffee, or kirsch, &amp;c., the type
of which is the Sabayon with cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2426—Cold Viennese Fritters"><a id="rcp.2426"
 >2426—COLD VIENNESE FRITTERS</a></h3>

<p>Roll out a piece of the paste prescribed, which should be kept
somewhat soft, and stamp it out with a round cutter two and a
half inches in diameter. Set half of these roundels of paste on
buttered sheets of paper, lying on trays; garnish them either with
stewed fruit or jam; slightly moisten their edges; cover them with
the remaining roundels of paste, and let the paste ferment for thirty
minutes.</p>

<p>A few minutes before serving, grasp the ends of the sheets of
paper; plunge the fritters into plenty of hot fat, and withdraw the
sheets of paper as soon as the fritters fall from them.</p>

<p><a id="png.736" href="#png.736"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>718<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Drain them as soon as they begin to colour; and plunge them
immediately into a light, hot syrup, flavoured as fancy may dictate.
Withdraw them as soon as they are beginning to be saturated, and
serve them cold.</p>

<p>N.B.—In the case of either of these two methods of serving
Viennese fritters, the latter, which are served under the name of
“fritters à la Dauphine,” may be garnished with fruit <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicons</i></a> or
cream preparations.</p>

<p>Put one pint of water, three and a half oz. of butter, a pinch of
salt and two pinches of sugar into a saucepan. Boil; take the
utensil off the fire in order to add two-thirds lb. of sifted flour, and
mix up the whole. Then dry this paste as directed for pâte à
choux (No. <a href="#rcp.2373">2373</a>); and finish it, away from the fire, with seven eggs,
added one by one.</p>

<p>Flavour according to taste.</p>

<p>Take this paste in portions, the size of small walnuts; put these
portions in moderately hot fat, and gradually increase the heat of
the latter, so as to ensure the rising of the paste.</p>

<p>When the fritters are quite dry outside, drain them; dish them
on a napkin, and sprinkle them with icing sugar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2428—Souffléd Fritters “en Surprise”"><a id="rcp.2428"
 >2428—SOUFFLÉD FRITTERS “EN SURPRISE”</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the fritters exactly like the preceding ones. When
taking them out of the fat, open them slightly and garnish them, by
means of the piping-bag, either with stewed fruit, jam, a very
fine, thickened <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of fruit, or some kind of cream, especially
frangipan or pastry cream.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2436—Apple Charlotte"><a id="rcp.2436"
 >2436—APPLE CHARLOTTE</a></h3>

<p>Copiously butter a quart Charlotte-mould. Garnish its bottom
with heart-shaped <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> of bread-crumb, slightly overlapping one
another; and garnish its sides with rectangles of bread of exactly
the same height as the mould, and also slightly overlapping one
another. The <i><a href="#g_croutons">croûtons</a></i> and the rectangles should be one-eighth inch
thick, and ought to have been dipped in melted butter before taking
their place in the mould.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, quarter twelve fine russet apples; peel, slice, and
cook them in a sautépan with one oz. of butter, two tablespoonfuls
of powdered sugar, and half the rind of a lemon and a little
cinnamon—both tied into a faggot.</p>

<p>When the apples are cooked, and reduced to a thick purée,
remove the faggot of aromatics and add three tablespoonfuls of
stewed apricots.</p>

<p>Fill up the mould with this preparation, and remember to shape
the latter in a projecting dome above the mould; for it settles in
cooking.</p>

<p>Bake in a good, moderate oven for from thirty to thirty-five
minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2437—Charlotte de Pommes, Emile Giret"><a id="rcp.2437"
 >2437—CHARLOTTE DE POMMES, EMILE GIRET</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the Charlotte as directed above, but in a shallow mould.</p>

<p>When it is moulded on the dish, completely cover it with an
even coat, half inch thick, of very firm “pastry cream” (No. <a href="#rcp.2401">2401</a>),
and take care not to spoil the shape of the Charlotte.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the cream copiously with icing sugar; then, with a
red-hot iron, criss-cross the Charlotte regularly all round; pressing
the iron upon the sugar-sprinkled cream.</p>

<p>Surround the base of the Charlotte with a row of beads made
<a id="png.739" href="#png.739"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>721<span class="ns">]

<h3 class="recipe" title="2438—Various Charlottes"><a id="rcp.2438"
 >2438—VARIOUS CHARLOTTES</a></h3>

<p>Charlottes may be made with pears, peaches, apricots, &amp;c., after
the same procedure as that directed under No. <a href="#rcp.2436">2436</a>. The most
important point to be remembered in their preparation is that the
stewed fruit used should be very stiff; otherwise it so softens
the shell of bread that the Charlotte collapses as soon as it is
turned out.</p>

<p>It is no less important that the mould should be as full as
possible of the preparation used; for, as already explained, the
latter settles in the cooking process.</p>

 >2439—CRÈME <span class="nw">A LA RÉGENCE</span><!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Saturate half a pound of “Biscuits à<!-- TN: original lacks grave --> la Cuiller” with Maraschino-Kirsch,
and then dip them into a quart of boiled milk. Rub them
through a silk sieve, and add eight eggs, ten egg-yolks, two-thirds
pound of powdered sugar and a small pinch of table salt. Pour
the whole into a shallow, Charlotte mould, and set to poach in a
<a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> for about thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Let the mould rest for a few minutes; turn out its contents on a
dish and surround the base of the cream with a crown of stewed
half-apricots, each garnished with a preserved cherry. Coat the
whole with an apricot syrup, flavoured with Kirsch and Maraschino.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2440—Crème Meringuée"><a id="rcp.2440"
 >2440—CRÈME MERINGUÉE<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Prepare some “Crème à<!-- TN: original lacks grave --> la Régence” as above, and poach it in
a buttered deep border-mould. Poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>; turn out on
a dish, and garnish the middle of the border with Italian meringue
(No.<!-- TN: period invisible --> <a href="#rcp.2383">2383</a>), combined with a <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of preserved fruit, macerated
in Kirsch.</p>

<p>Decorate the border by means of a piping-bag, fitted with a
grooved pipe and filled with plain, Italian meringue, without the
fruit; and set to brown in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>Serve an orange-flavoured, English custard separately.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2441—Village Custard"><a id="rcp.2441"
 >2441—VILLAGE CUSTARD</a></h3>

<p>Saturate five ounces of dry biscuits with Kirsch and Anisette,
and set them in a deep dish in layers, alternated with coatings of
stewed, seasonable fruit, such as pears, apples, etc.</p>

<p>Cover the whole with the following preparation: one-half pound
of powdered sugar mixed with eight eggs and the yolks of four, and
<a id="png.740" href="#png.740"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>722<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>diluted with one and three-quarter pints of milk. Poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>,
in the oven.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2442—Custard Pudding"><a id="rcp.2442"
 >2442—CUSTARD PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>Custard pudding is a form of the English custard mentioned
under No. <a href="#rcp.2397">2397</a>.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is that for the former whole
eggs are used instead of the yolks alone, and that it is prepared
according to the second method only. The average quantities for
the preparation are:</p>

<p>Six eggs and six ounces of sugar per quart of milk. The
custard is cooked in pie-dishes in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, which should be
placed in the oven or in a steamer.</p>

<p>According as to whether the custard be required milky or
thick, the number of eggs is either lessened or increased. In
regard to the sugar, the guide should be the consumers’ tastes. If
necessary, it may be suppressed altogether, and saccharine or
glycerine may be used in its stead, as is customary for diabetic
patients.</p>

<p>Custard is generally flavoured with vanilla, but any other flavour
suited to sweets may be used with it.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2479—Puddings"><a id="rcp.2479"
 >2479—PUDDINGS</a></h3>

<p>English puddings are almost innumerable; but many of them
lie more within the pastrycook’s than the cook’s province, and their
enumeration here could not serve a very useful purpose. The name
Pudding is, moreover, applied to a whole host of preparations which
are really nothing more than custards—as, for example, “custard
pudding.” If both of the foregoing kinds of puddings be passed over,
puddings proper which belong to hot sweets may be divided
into eight classes, of which I shall first give the generic recipes, from
<a id="png.748" href="#png.748"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>730<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which all pudding entremets given hereafter are derived. The
eight classes <span class="nw">are:—</span></p>

<ul class="list">
<li>(1) Puddings with cream.</li>
<li>(2) Fruit puddings.</li>
<li>(3) English fruit puddings.</li>
<li>(4) Plum puddings.</li>
<li>(5) French and German bread puddings.</li>
<li>(6) English and French paste puddings.</li>
<li>(7) Rice puddings.</li>
<li>(8) Souffléd puddings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Puddings allow of various accompanying sauces, which will be
given in each recipe. The majority of English puddings may be
accompanied by stewed fruit, Melba sauce, or whipped cream “à la
Chantilly.”</p>

<p>Make a preparation for souffléd pudding (No. <a href="#rcp.2505">2505</a>), moistened
with almond milk. Pour it into copiously-buttered moulds,
sprinkled inside with splintered and grilled almonds.</p>

<p>Set to poach in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>. As an accompaniment serve a

<h3 class="recipe" title="2481—English Almond Pudding"><a id="rcp.2481"
 >2481—ENGLISH ALMOND PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>Mix to the consistence of a pomade four oz. of butter and
five oz. of powdered sugar; add eight oz. of finely-chopped
almonds, a pinch of table salt, a half table-spoonful of orange-flower
water, two eggs, two egg-yolks, and one-sixth pint of cream.
Pour this preparation into a buttered pie-dish, and cook in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>

<p>N.B.—English puddings of what kind soever are served in the

<p>Crush eight oz. of lady’s-finger biscuits in a saucepan, and
moisten them with one pint of boiling milk containing five oz. of
sugar. Stir the whole over the fire, and add five oz. of candied
fruit, cut into dice and mixed with currants (both products having
been macerated in kirsch), three egg-yolks, four oz. of melted
butter, and the white of five eggs beaten to a stiff froth.</p>

<p>Set to poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, in a low, even Charlotte mould,
or in a pie-dish, and serve an apricot sauce at the same time.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2483—Cabinet Pudding"><a id="rcp.2483"
 >2483—CABINET PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>Garnish a buttered cylinder-mould with lady’s-finger biscuits
or slices of buttered biscuit, saturated with some kind of liqueur;
<a id="png.749" href="#png.749"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>731<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>arranging them in alternate layers with a <a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of candied fruit
and currants, macerated in liqueur. Here and there spread a little
apricot jam.</p>

<p>Fill up the mould, little by little, with preparation No. <a href="#rcp.2639">2639</a>,
flavoured according to fancy. Poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>Turn out the pudding at the last moment, and coat it with
English custard flavoured with vanilla.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2484—Fruit Pudding"><a id="rcp.2484"
 >2484—FRUIT PUDDING</a></h3>

<p>This pudding requires very careful treatment. The custard
which serves as its base is the same as that of Cabinet Pudding,
except that it is thickened by seven eggs and seven egg-yolks per
quart of milk. This preparation is, moreover, combined with a
purée of fruit suited to the pudding.</p>

<p><i>Procedure</i>: Butter a mould; set it in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, and pour a
few table-spoonfuls of the above preparation into it. Let it set, and
upon this set custard sprinkle a layer of suitable fruit, sliced. This
fruit may be apricots, peaches, pears, etc. Cover the fruit with a
fresh coat of custard, but more copiously than in the first case; let
this custard set as before; cover it with fruit, and proceed in the
same order until the mould is full.</p>

<p>It is, in short, another form of aspic-jelly preparation, but hot
instead of cold. If the solidification of the layers of custard were
not ensured, the fruit would fall to the bottom of the mould instead
of remaining distributed between the layers of custard, and the
result would be the collapse of the pudding as soon as it was
turned out.</p>

<p>Continue the cooking in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>; let the preparation
stand a few minutes before turning it out, and serve at the same
time a sauce made from the same fruit as that used for the pudding.</p>

suet, quarter of a pint of water and a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Let the paste rest for an hour, and roll it out to a thickness of
one-third of an inch.</p>

<p>With this layer of paste, line a well-buttered dome-mould or large
pudding-basin. Garnish with sliced apples mixed with powdered
sugar and flavoured with a chopped piece of lemon peel.</p>

<p>Close the mould with a well-sealed-down layer of paste; wrap
the mould in a piece of linen, which should be firmly fastened with
string; plunge it into a saucepan containing boiling water, and in

a lemon; one-third oz. of mixed spices, containing a large quantity
of cinnamon; three eggs; quarter of a pint of rum or brandy, and

<p>These tarts are made in deep pie or pastry-dishes. Whatever
be the fruit used, clean it, peel it, or core it, according to its nature.
Some fruits are sliced while others are merely quartered or left
whole.</p>

<p>Set them in the dish, to within half inch of its brim;
sprinkle them with moist or powdered sugar, and (in the case of
fruit with firm pulps like apples) with a few tablespoonfuls of
water.</p>

<p>This addition of water is optional and, in any case, may be dispensed
with for aqueous fruits. First cover the edges of the dish,
which should be moistened slightly, with a strip of short paste, an
inch wide. Then cover the dish with a layer of puff-paste, which
seal down well to the strip of paste, already in position and
slightly moistened for the purpose. With a brush moisten the
layer of paste constituting the cover of the tart; sprinkle it with
sugar, and set the tart to bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>All English tarts are made in this way, and all fruits may be
used with them even when, as in the case of gooseberries, they are
green.</p>

<p>Put the preparation on a mild fire until it properly veneers the
withdrawn spoon, and do not let it boil. Pass it through the
strainer into an enamelled basin; let it cool, stirring it from time

pints of whipped cream, three oz. of powdered sugar, and two-thirds oz. of vanilla sugar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2615—Bavarois aux Fruits"><a id="rcp.2615"

dissolved gelatine, strained through linen, and one pint of whipped
cream. The preparation for fruit Bavarois may be combined with
fruit of the same nature as that used for the purée; and this fruit
may be added raw in the case of strawberries, raspberries, red-currants,

peaches, apricots, etc.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2616—The Moulding and Dishing of Bavarois"><a id="rcp.2616"
 >2616—THE MOULDING AND DISHING OF BAVAROIS</a></h3>

<p>Bavarois are generally moulded in fancy moulds fitted with
a central tube, slightly greased with sweet almond oil. When
they are greased they are incrusted in broken ice after the preparation
has been covered with a round sheet of white paper.</p>

<p>When about to serve, the mould is quickly plunged into tepid
water, wiped, and turned out upon a dish, which may or may not be
covered with a folded napkin.</p>

<p>Instead of oiling the moulds they may be covered with a thin
coat of sugar cooked to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">caramel</a></i> stage, which besides making
<a id="png.776" href="#png.776"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>758<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the Bavarois sightly, also gives it an excellent taste. Another very
advisable method is that of serving the Bavarois in a deep silver
timbale or dish, surrounded with ice. In this case, the entremet not
having to be turned out, the preparation does not need to be so
cohesive, and is therefore much more delicate.</p>

<p>When the Bavarois is served after this last method it is sometimes
accompanied by stewed fruit or a <i><a href="#g_macedoine">Macédoine</a></i> of fresh fruit;
though, in reality, these fruit adjuncts are better suited to cold
puddings, which, in some points, are not unlike Bavarois.</p>

<p>Finally, when the Bavarois is moulded, it may be decorated,
just before being served, with Chantilly cream laid on by means of
a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2624—Blanc-mange"><a id="rcp.2624"
 >2624—BLANC-MANGE</a></h3>

<p>Blanc-mange is scarcely ever served nowadays, and this is a
pity; seeing that, when it is well prepared, it is one of the best
entremets that can be set before a diner. Blanc-mange, as it is
prepared in England, is quite different from that generally served;
but it is nevertheless an excellent and very wholesome entremet,
and that is why I have given its recipe below.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in order to justify its name, blanc-mange
ought always to be beautifully white; but, for a long
time since, the compound word has lost its original meaning.
The adjective and noun composing it have fused one with the
other to form a single generic title, which may now be applied with
equal propriety to both coloured and white preparations; and the
verbal error is so old, dating as it does from pre-Carême times, that
it would be futile to try and correct it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2625—French Blanc-mange"><a id="rcp.2625"
 >2625—FRENCH BLANC-MANGE</a></h3>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>—Skin one lb. of sweet almonds and four or five
bitter almonds, and soak them well in fresh water that they may be
quite white.</p>

<p>Pound them as finely as possible; adding to them the while (in
spoonfuls at a time) one pint of water. Strain the whole through a
strong towel, twisting the latter tightly; melt one lb. of loaf-sugar
in the resulting milk (about one and half pints); add a bare oz.
of gelatine dissolved in tepid syrup; strain the whole through
muslin, and flavour according to taste.</p>

<p><span class="nw"><i>Moulding</i>:—</span>Mould the blanc-mange in oiled moulds fitted with
centre-tubes as for Bavarois. Incrust them in ice that their
contents may set, and proceed for the turning-out as already
directed.</p>

<p>N.B.—For the preparation of almond milk, modern Cookery has
substituted for the procedure given above, which is antiquated,
another which consists in pounding the almonds with only a few
table-spoonfuls of water and some very thin cream.</p>

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2626"
 >2626—BLANC-MANGE WITH FRUIT AND LIQUEURS</a></h3>

<p>All fruits, reduced to purées, may serve in the preparation of
blanc-manges, and the apportionment of the ingredients should
be as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>the purée of the selected fruit and the preparation
given above (including the same amount of gelatine) should be
mixed in equal quantities.</p>

<p>These blanc-manges take the name of the fruit with which they
are prepared, <i>i.e.</i>: strawberries, raspberries, apricots, peaches, etc.
They may also be prepared with liqueurs, which should be in the
proportion of one liqueur glassful to one quart of the preparation.
The best liqueurs for the purpose are Kirsch, Maraschino and
Rum.</p>

<p>Blanc-manges are also made from chocolate and coffee, although
the flavour of the latter does not blend so well with that of almonds
as do the other products.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2627—Blanc-manges “Rubannés”"><a id="rcp.2627"
 >2627—BLANC-MANGES “RUBANNÉS<!-- TN: acute invisible -->”</a></h3>

<p>Prepare these as directed under No. <a href="#rcp.2621">2621</a>, spreading the differently
flavoured and coloured blanc-mange preparations in alternate
even and regular layers.</p>

<p>N.B.—Blanc-mange preparations may also be dished in silver
timbales, in good china cases, or in deep dishes. By this means,
to the great improvement of the preparation, the gelatine may be
reduced to a minimum quantity, just enough to ensure the setting
of the blanc-mange and no more. And the thing is quite possible
inasmuch as there is no question of turning out the entremet.</p>

<p>In his book “The Parisian Cook,” Carême recommends the
addition to the Blanc-mange of a quarter of its volume of very
fresh, good cream; and the advice, coming as it does from such an
authoritative source, is worth following.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2628—English Blanc-mange"><a id="rcp.2628"
 >2628—ENGLISH BLANC-MANGE</a></h3>

<p>Boil one quart of milk, containing four oz. of sugar, and pour it
over a quarter of a lb. of corn-flour diluted with half a pint of cold
milk; stirring briskly the while.</p>

<p>Smooth the preparation with the whisk, and cook it over an
open fire for a few minutes, without ceasing to stir.</p>

<p>On taking it off the fire, flavour it according to taste; and pour
it, very hot, into moulds previously moistened with syrup, that the
mouldings may turn out glossy and smooth.</p>

<p>Let the contents of the moulds set; turn them out, and serve
them very cold either plain or with an accompaniment of stewed

the uprights snugly one against the other. Meanwhile, take some
strawberry, chocolate, pistachio and apricot Bavarois preparations,
and let them set in flawn-rings, lying on pieces of oiled paper.</p>

<p>Cut the Bavarois preparations into large dice, and mix them
with an ordinary, and somewhat liquid, cream Bavarois preparation.
Pour the whole into the mould, and leave to cool. When about to

<h3 class="recipe" title="2638—Creams"><a id="rcp.2638"
 >2638—CREAMS</a></h3>

<p>Cold creams, served as entremets, belong to two very distinct
classes:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Cooked Creams</i>, which are, in short, but a variety of custard.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Creams derived from natural, fresh cream</i>, whipped and
sugared, the generic type of which is Chantilly cream.</p>

<p><i>Cooked Creams</i> are prepared either in special little pots, in
small silver or porcelain bowls, or in moulds. Those prepared in
moulds are turned out when they are quite cold, and are called
“Crèmes renversées” to distinguish them from the first two kinds
which are always served in the utensil in which they have cooked.</p>

<p>For all that, the term “Crème renversée” has grown somewhat
obsolete, and the modern expression for this kind of custards is
“Crème moulée.”</p>

<p><i>Crème au Caramel</i> represents a perfect type of this class.</p>

<p>The custards served in their cooking-receptacles are more
delicate than the others, because their preparation does not demand
such a large quantity of eggs; but they are only served in the
home, like English custard. For a stylish luncheon or dinner,
moulded custards (Fr. crèmes moulées) are best.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2639—Crème à la Vanille, Moulée"><a id="rcp.2639"
 >2639—CRÈME <span class="nw">A LA VANILLE</span>, MOULÉE<!-- TN: acute invisible --></a></h3>

<p>Boil one quart of milk containing one-half lb. of sugar; add a
stick of vanilla, and let the latter infuse for twenty minutes. Pour this
milk, little by little, over three eggs and eight yolks, previously
whisked in a basin, and whisk briskly the while. Pass the whole
through a fine sieve; let it rest for a moment or two; then
completely remove all the froth lying on its surface, and pour the
preparation into buttered moulds or into vases specially made for
this purpose. Set to poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, in a moderate oven,
keeping lids on the utensils.</p>

<p>Not for one moment must the water in the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a> boil
while the poaching is in progress; for the air contained by the
preparation would then become over-heated, and the result
would be an infinity of small holes throughout the depth of the
custard, which would greatly mar its appearance.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the custard should poach, that is to say,
<a id="png.782" href="#png.782"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>764<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>coagulate, as the result of the surrounding water being kept at a
constant temperature of 185° F. As soon as it is poached, let the
custard cool.</p>

<p>When it is poached in the utensils in which it is served, one egg
and eight yolks per quart of milk will be found sufficient. The
utensils should be carefully wiped and dished on a napkin.</p>

<p>If the custard is to be turned out, carefully overturn the mould
upon a dish, and pull it off a few minutes later. Moulded and
potted custards admit of all the flavourings proper to entremets;
but those which suit them best are vanilla, almond milk, almond
and filbert <a href="#g_pralin"><i>pralin</i></a>, coffee, chocolate, etc. Unless used in the form
of very concentrated essences, fruit flavours are less suited to them.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_clothe">Clothe</a></i> the bottom and sides of a mould with sugar cooked to the

<p>Pour it into moulds with buttered sides; set these to poach in
the <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>, and leave them to cool. Turn out, and coat with a

reasonably sugared.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2650—Jellies"><a id="rcp.2650"
 >2650—JELLIES</a></h3>

<p>From the standpoint of their preparation, jellies are of two
kinds: (1) wine- or liqueur-flavoured jellies; (2) fruit jellies. But
their base is the same in all cases, <i>i.e.</i>, gelatine dissolved in a
certain quantity of water.</p>

<p><a id="png.784" href="#png.784"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>766<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The gelatine should be extracted from calf’s foot, by boiling
the latter; but, although this is the best that can be obtained, the
means of obtaining it are the most complicated. The gelatine
bought ready-made may also be used in the quantities given
below.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2651—Calf’s-foot Jelly"><a id="rcp.2651"
 >2651—CALF’S-FOOT JELLY</a></h3>

<p>Take some fine soaked and <i><a href="#g_blanch">blanched</a></i> calves’ feet, and set them
to cook in one and three-quarters pints of water apiece. Skim as
thoroughly as possible; cover, and then cook very gently for seven
hours. This done, strain the cooking-liquor and clear it of all
grease; test its strength, after having cooled a little of it on ice;
rectify it if necessary with sufficient filtered water, and once more
test it by means of ice.</p>

<p>Per quart of calf’s-foot jelly, add eight oz. of sugar, a mite of
cinnamon, half the rind of an orange and lemon, and all their
juice.</p>

<p>For the clarification, proceed as directed hereafter.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2652—Jelly with a Gelatine Base"><a id="rcp.2652"
 >2652—JELLY WITH A GELATINE BASE</a></h3>

<p>Dissolve one oz. of strong gelatine in a quart of water. Add
one-half lb. of sugar, one-sixth oz. of coriander, and the <a href="#g_zest">zest</a> and
juice of half a lemon and of a whole orange; boil, and then let
the preparation stand for ten minutes away from the fire.</p>

<p>Whisk one and a half egg-whites in a very clean saucepan,
together with a port wine-glassful of white wine, and pour the
cleared syrup, little by little, over the egg-whites, whisking briskly
the while. Set the saucepan on the fire, and continue whisking
until the boil is reached; then move the utensil to a corner
of the stove, and keep the jelly only just simmering for one-quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>At the end of that time the clarification is completed; strain
the jelly through a woollen bag, placed over a very clean bowl,
and, if the jelly is turbid after the first time of straining, strain it
again and again until it becomes quite clear. Let it almost cool
before adding any flavour.</p>

<p><i>The Flavouring.</i>—Whether the jelly be prepared from calves’
feet or from gelatine, the above preparation is naught else than a
cohered syrup, to which the addition of some flavour lends the
character of a jelly. The complementary ingredients for jellies are
liqueurs, good wines, and the juice of fruit; and the quantity of water
prescribed should be so reduced as to allow for the ultimate
addition of the liquid flavouring.</p>

<p>Thus, every jelly of which the flavour is a liqueur ought to be
prepared with only nine-tenths of a quart of water; and the
<a id="png.785" href="#png.785"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>767<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>remaining one-tenth of the measure is subsequently added in the
form of Kirsch, Maraschino, Rum, or Anisette, etc.</p>

<p><i>A jelly flavoured with a good wine</i>, such as Champagne,
Madeira, Sherry, Marsala, etc., should contain only seven-tenths
of a quart of water and three-tenths of a quart of the selected
wine.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>fruit jellies</i>, the procedure differs in accordance
with the kind of fruit used.</p>

<p>For <i>red-fruit jellies</i>, prepared from strawberries, raspberries,
red-currants, cherries, and cranberries, these fruits, which should
be very ripe, are rubbed through a sieve, and combined with one-tenth
to three-tenths of a quart of water per lb., according as to
whether the fruit be more or less juicy.</p>

<p>This done, filter the resulting juice, and add it to the jelly in the
proportion of one part of the former to two parts of the latter.
The jelly should therefore be twice as strong as for the previous
preparation, in order that it may remain sufficiently consistent in
spite of the added juice.</p>

<p>When the fruit is too juicy, rub it through a sieve; let the
juice ferment for a few hours, and only filter the clear juice which
results from the fermentation.</p>

<p><i>Aqueous-fruit jellies</i>, prepared from grapes, oranges, lemons,
and tangerines, are made in the same way. The filtering of these
fruit juices is easily done, and, except for the grapes, they need not
be set to ferment.</p>

<p>When these fruits are not quite ripe, their juices may be added
to the jelly even before the clarification—a procedure which helps
to modify their acidity. The apportionment of the fruit juices
to the jelly is practically the same as that of the red-fruit juices.</p>

<p><i>Stone-fruit</i>, such as apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, etc., are
often used as jelly garnishes, but seldom serve as the flavouring
base of a jelly. Whenever they are treated in this way, they are
first plunged in boiling water, that they may be peeled; they are
then poached and left to cool in the syrup which goes towards
preparing the jelly.</p>

<p>This jelly, after it has been clarified and three-parts cooled,
should have a little Kirsch or Maraschino added to it, that its
fruit flavour may be intensified.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2653—The Garnish and Accompaniments of Jellies"><a id="rcp.2653"
 >2653—THE GARNISH AND ACCOMPANIMENTS OF JELLIES</a></h3>

<p>As a rule, jellies are served plain. Sometimes, however, they
are garnished with variously-shaped, stewed fruits, symmetrically
distributed in the jelly, with their colours nicely contrasted.</p>

<p>A jelly prepared in this way is called a “Suédoise of fruit.”</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2654—Gelées Rubannées"><a id="png.786" href="#png.786"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>768<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2654"
 >2654—GELÉES<!-- TN: acute invisible --> RUBANNÉES</a></h3>

<p>These are differently-flavoured and differently-coloured jellies
moulded in alternate layers, even and equally thick.</p>

<p>They are generally served without garnish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2655—Jellies à la Russe"><a id="rcp.2655"
 >2655—JELLIES <span class="nw">A LA RUSSE</span></a></h3>

<p>These are ordinary jellies which are whisked over ice until they
begin to set. They are then speedily moulded. By skilfully
mixing two or three of these jellies, of different shades and
flavours, at the moment of moulding, very effective “Marbled
Jellies” are obtained.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2656—Jellies à la Moscovite"><a id="rcp.2656"
 >2656—JELLIES <span class="nw">A LA MOSCOVITE</span></a></h3>

<p>These are ordinary jellies, poured into tightly-closing moulds,
the sealing of which is ensured by a thread of butter, laid round
the edges of the lids. The moulds are then surrounded with
broken ice, mixed with five lb. of freezing salt and eight oz. of
saltpetre per twenty-five lb. of ice.</p>

<p>The cold produced by the salted ice causes a frosted coat to
form round the jelly, the effect of which is exceedingly pretty.
But the moulds should be withdrawn from the ice as soon as the
frosted coat is formed and the jelly is set; for a longer sojourn in
the cold would transform the jelly into an uneatable block of ice.</p>

<p>N.B.—Modern methods have greatly simplified the dishing and
serving of jellies. They are now dished in special silver bowls or
deep dishes, and they are not, as a rule, moulded. The bottom of
these utensils is sometimes decked with stewed fruit or <i><a href="#g_macedoine">macédoines</a></i>
of fruit which are covered with the jelly; and, as the latter is
served in the utensil itself, the quantity of gelatine may be
reduced, and greater delicacy is the result.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2657—Pains de Fruits"><a id="rcp.2657"
 >2657—PAINS DE FRUITS</a></h3>

<p>These “pains” are made in ordinary Charlotte moulds.</p>

<p><i><a href="#g_clothe">Clothe</a></i> the mould with a fairly thick coat of jelly, in keeping
with the flavour of the fruit used, which may be apricots, strawberries,
red-currants, cherries, peaches, etc. Fill up the mould
with a preparation, made as for a fruit Bavarois, but without
cream.</p>

<p>The amount of gelatine used should therefore be reduced.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2658—Cold Puddings"><a id="rcp.2658"
 >2658—COLD PUDDINGS</a></h3>

<p>Cold puddings have a great deal in common with Bavarois
and, more often than not, these two kinds of sweets have the same
base. Their distinguishing difference lies in the fact that Bavarois
are generally served without a garnish or sauce, whereas puddings
always have either one or the other, and sometimes both.</p>

<p><a id="png.787" href="#png.787"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Their garnishes always consist of fruit, and the latter is either
stewed and served separately, or it is candied and combined with
the pudding paste.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2659—Pudding à la Bohémienne"><a id="rcp.2659"
 >2659—PUDDING <span class="nw">A LA BOHÉMIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Make some very small pancakes, and garnish them with a
<a href="#g_salpicon"><i>salpicon</i></a> of candied fruits and currants swelled in tepid water,
cohered with some fairly stiff, apple purée. Close up the pancakes
to the shape of balls or rectangles, and set them in a buttered
border-mould. Fill up the mould with a moulded-custard preparation
(No. <a href="#rcp.2639">2639</a>), containing a good proportion of whole eggs,
and poach in a <a href="#g_bain-marie"><i>bain-marie</i></a>.</p>

<p>Leave the whole to cool in the mould; turn out at the last
moment, and coat the pudding with a <i>sabayon</i>, flavoured according
to fancy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2660—Pudding Diplomate"><a id="rcp.2660"
 >2660—PUDDING DIPLOMATE</a></h3>

<p>Decorate the bottom of an oiled deep Bavarois-mould with
pieces of candied fruit. Fill up the mould with alternate layers
of vanilla-flavoured Bavarois preparation and “lady’s-finger-biscuits,”
saturated with Kirsch. On each layer of biscuit sprinkle
some currants and raisins swelled in tepid water, and here and
there set a tablespoonful of apricot jam.</p>

<p>Let the contents of the mould set in the cool or on ice, and
turn out just before serving.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2661—Pudding Diplomate aux Fruits"><a id="rcp.2661"
 >2661—PUDDING DIPLOMATE AUX FRUITS</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the pudding as above, but spread a few extra layers of
fresh fruit in the mould, such as very ripe pears, peaches, apricots,
etc., all peeled, cut into thin slices, and previously macerated with
powdered sugar and half a port wine-glassful of either Kirsch,
Maraschino, or Anisette, etc.</p>

<p>When the pudding is turned out, surround its base with some
very cold stewed fruit the same as one of the kinds used inside
the pudding, or some stewed, mixed fruit.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2662—Pudding Malakoff"><a id="rcp.2662"
 >2662—PUDDING MALAKOFF</a></h3>

<p>Prepare (1) a gelatinous English custard, combined with one pint
of very fresh, raw cream per quart; (2) a stew of apples and pears,
prepared as for an apple Charlotte; currants and sultanas, swelled
in tepid syrup; fresh splintered almonds; candied orange rind,
cut into dice; slices of stale biscuit, or lady’s-finger biscuits,
saturated with liqueur. Oil a Charlotte mould, and pour into it
a layer of cream half an inch thick. Upon this cream lay
<a id="png.788" href="#png.788"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>770<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a thickness of biscuits, copiously coated with marmalade, and
sprinkle with raisins, almonds and orange-rind dice.</p>

<p>Cover with a layer of cream; lay a second thickness of biscuits,
and proceed thus in the same order with a Kirsch-flavoured cold
<i>sabayon</i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2663—Pudding à la Nesselrode"><a id="rcp.2663"
 >2663—PUDDING <span class="nw">A LA NESSELRODE</span></a></h3>

<p>To an English custard, prepared after No. <a href="#rcp.2397">2397</a>, add eight oz.
of a smooth, chestnut purée, and four oz. of currants and sultanas
(swelled in tepid water), and candied orange-rind and cherries,
cut into dice; these four products should be in almost equal
quantities, and ought to have been previously macerated in
sweetened Madeira.</p>

<p>Add some Maraschino-flavoured, whipped cream to the preparation;
apportioning it as for a Bavarois.</p>

<p>Garnish the bottom and sides of a Charlotte mould with white
paper; pour the preparation into the mould; completely close the
latter, sealing the lid down with a thread of butter, and surround
the utensil with plenty of salted ice. When about to serve, turn
out on a napkin; remove the paper, and surround the base of the
pudding with a crown of fine, candied chestnuts, or balls of chocolate-iced,
candied chestnut purée.</p>

<p>N.B.—The English custard may be packed in the freezer,
mixed with whipped cream when it is almost congealed, and then
placed in a mould.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2664—Pudding à la Richelieu"><a id="rcp.2664"
 >2664—PUDDING <span class="nw">A LA RICHELIEU</span></a></h3>

<p>Rub some stewed prunes through a fine sieve, and add to the
purée equal quantities of very stiff, Kirsch-flavoured jelly and the
reduced juice of the prunes. Let a layer three-quarters of an inch
thick, of the preparation set on the bottom of a Charlotte mould.
In the latter set a smaller mould (tinned outside), filled with
broken ice, and either fitted with handles that can rest on the brim
of the first mould, or else sufficiently deep to be easily grasped
and removed when necessary. The space between the sides of the
two moulds should measure about three-quarters of an inch.</p>

<p>Fill up this space with what remains of the prune purée,
thickened with jelly; leave the preparation to set; withdraw the
ice from the little mould; pour some tepid water into the latter,
that it may be immediately detached from the surrounding,
iced preparation.</p>

<p>Fill the space left by the withdrawn mould with some vanilla-flavoured
Bavarois preparation; leave to set, and turn out at the
last moment on a napkin.</p>

<p>Prepare the whites of four eggs as for Italian <i>meringue</i> (No. <a href="#rcp.2383">2383</a>), and add to the sugar, while cooking, its bulk of quince
jelly, and, at the last moment, one and a half ounces of candied
fruit, cut into dice, <i>macerated</i> in Kirsch and carefully drained. Set
the <i>meringue</i>, in shapes resembling large buttons, on a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>Boil in a utensil large enough to take the sheet of paper, four
quarts of water, containing two and a half lb. of sugar and one-quarter
pint of Kirsch. Slip the sheet of paper into this boiling
syrup; withdraw it as soon as it easily separates from the pieces
of <i>meringue</i>; poach the latter; drain them on a piece of linen
and let them cool.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, make two Bavarois preparations; one white and
vanilla-flavoured, and the other pink and flavoured with Curaçao<!-- TN: original reads "Curaçoa" -->.
In these preparations the quantity of whisked cream should be
twice as much as for ordinary Bavarois, whereas the quantity of
gelatine should be reduced by half.</p>

<p>Set these preparations in even, alternate layers, in a slightly-oiled
iced-<i><a href="#g_madeleine">Madeleine mould</a></i>, distributing the <i>meringues</i> between
each layer.</p>

<p>Cover the mould with a piece of paper and a lid, and keep it
surrounded by ice for two hours. When about to serve, turn it
out on a napkin.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Ices</span>, with their accompanying “petits fours,” bring the dinner
to a close—at least as far as Cookery is concerned; and, when they
are well prepared and daintily dished, they are the consummation
of all that is delicate and good. In no other department of the
work has the culinary artist so freely indulged his fancy, or created
such delectable kickshaws; and, though Italy be the cradle of the
ice-worker’s art, though the Neapolitans have deservedly maintained
their reputation as authorities in this matter, to French workmen,
certainly, is due the credit of those innovations which have perfected
this important branch of dietetic science.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2744—The Making of Ices"><a id="rcp.2744"
 >2744—THE MAKING OF ICES</a></h3>

<p>Whatever be the kind of ices required, they should always
be prepared in advance; for none of these preparations can be
made ready at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>There are two distinct operations in the confection of <span class="nw">ices:—</span></p>

<p>(1) The making of the preparation.</p>

<p>(2) The freezing and the moulding of the preparation. I shall
begin by dealing with the second operation, which remains the
same for all ices, and is the essential part of the procedure.</p>

<p>To freeze an ice preparation is to surround it with broken ice,
mixed with sodium chloride (sea-salt or freezing salt) and saltpetre.
The action of these two salts upon the ice causes a considerable
drop in the temperature, which speedily congeals any contiguous
liquid. Subject to their nature, ices are either moulded and frozen
directly in their moulds, like the light ices: iced Biscuits, iced
<i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflés</a></i>, Puddings, <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a></i>, Parfaits, Bombes, etc.; or first frozen
in a special utensil called a freezer, and then moulded and frozen
afresh. Cream and syrup ices are prepared by the second method;
and this I shall now describe.</p>

<p>The freezers, in which the freezing takes place, are generally
wielded by hand, either directly or by means of some mechanism.
They should be of pure tin, and fitted, at their base on to a central
<a id="png.807" href="#png.807"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>789<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pivot which turns in a socket, fixed in the wooden case which holds
the freezer.</p>

<p>Having hermetically closed the latter, surround it with broken ice
containing three lbs. of salt and eight oz. of saltpetre per twenty-five lbs.</p>

<p>The freezer should be one-third of its height out of the ice, in
order that no particle of salted ice may accidentally fall into
the preparation while it is being frozen. The ice should be snugly
massed, by means of a special pestle, round the freezer. This
operation constitutes the packing, and should be effected at least
ten minutes in advance if possible.</p>

<p>Having thus prepared the freezer, pour into it the preparation
to be frozen and then either keep it in motion by rocking the
utensil to and fro, by grasping the handle on the cover (if the
apparatus is worked by hand), or by turning the handle if the
utensil is on a central axle, fitted with the usual mechanism. In
either case, the rotary movement of the utensil causes the preparation
to splash continually against the sides of the freezer, where it
rapidly congeals, and the congealed portions are removed by means
of a special spatula, as quickly as they form, until the whole
becomes a smooth and homogeneous mass. The delicacy and
creaminess of the ice depend a great deal upon the care with which
this freezing operation is effected; hence the preference which is
now given to freezers fitted with a mechanism whereby two fans
revolve inside in a direction opposite to that of the body of the
machine, and thus not only detach the congealed portions of the
preparation under treatment from the sides of the receptacle, but
also work it with a regularity impossible to human motion.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2745—The Moulding of Ices"><a id="rcp.2745"
 >2745—THE MOULDING OF ICES</a></h3>

<p>Having thus frozen the preparation, it may now be set in rock-form
on a napkin, as it used sometimes to be served in the past,
or in glasses. But as a rule it is put into special moulds, having
closely-fitting covers. These moulds should be carefully filled, and
banged on a folded napkin, that the ice may settle and drive out
any air which might be the cause of holes being found in the
preparation. When it is filled, place the mould in a receptacle of a
suitable size, and surround it with broken ice, prepared as for the
packing. The mould should remain at least an hour in the ice, in
the case of an ordinary ice, and an extra two hours if the ice
be light and not previously frozen as are the Bombes.</p>

<p>When about to serve, take the mould out of the ice; wash it to
rid it of the taint of salt; dip it in tepid water for an instant, that
the surface of the preparation inside may melt and separate easily
<a id="png.808" href="#png.808"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>790<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>from the mould. Overturn the mould; and turn out the ice upon
a folded napkin lying on a dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2746—Preparations for Simple Ices"><a id="rcp.2746"
 >2746—PREPARATIONS FOR SIMPLE ICES</a></h3>

<p>Preparations for simple ices are of two kinds: those made from
cream, and those made from syrup; the latter being principally
used for fruit ices.</p>

<p>As the quantities of sugar and eggs used for these preparations
vary exceedingly, the following recipes have been based upon a
working average.</p>

<p>If creamier ices be required, all that is needed is an increase in
the sugar and egg-yolks per quart of milk; while, if the ices be
required harder but less creamy, the two ingredients above
mentioned should be proportionately reduced.</p>

<p>As an example of the difference that may exist between cream
preparations, I might instance the case of ice-cream, which may be
made from seven to sixteen egg-yolks, and six oz. to one lb. of
sugar per quart of milk. In regard to ices made from syrups and
fruit, their preparations may measure from 15° to 30° or 32°.
(saccharometer) respectively.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2747—Ice-cream Preparation (Generic Recipe)"><a id="rcp.2747"
 >2747—ICE-CREAM PREPARATION (Generic Recipe)</a></h3>

<p>Work two-thirds lb. of sugar and ten egg-yolks in a saucepan
until the mixture reaches the <a href="#g_ribbon"><i>ribbon</i></a>-stage. Dilute it, little by little,
with one quart of boiling milk, and stir over a moderate fire until
the preparation veneers the withdrawn spoon. Avoid boiling, as it
might decompose the custard.</p>

<p>Strain the whole into a basin and stir it from time to time until
it is quite cold.</p>

<p>N.B.—For the various ice-cream preparations, the amount of
sugar and number of egg-yolks, as also the procedure, do not
change. They are only distinguishable by the particular flavour
or infusion which may happen to characterise them.</p>

<a id="png.810" href="#png.810"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>792<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when the preparation is congealed, it may be combined with one-sixth
pint of whipped cream per quart.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2758—Preparations for Fruit Ices"><a id="rcp.2758"
 >2758—PREPARATIONS FOR FRUIT ICES</a></h3>

<p>The base of these preparations is a syrup of sugar at 32°
(saccharom.), to which a purée of fruit, an essence, or a liqueur is
added, which will give the ice its character. All these preparations
require lemon juice, the quantity of which varies according to the
acidity of the fruit used, but which, even in the case of the tartest
fruits, should not measure less than the amount that may be extracted
from a whole lemon per quart of the preparation.</p>

<p>Orange juice may also be used, more especially for red-fruit
ices; while the juices of the orange and the lemons combined
throw the flavour of the fruit under treatment into remarkable
relief.</p>

<p>In the season the juices are extracted from fresh fruit, pressed
and rubbed through tammy. When the season is over the
preserved juice of fruit is used.</p>

<p>All red-fruit ices are improved, once they are set, by an
addition of half pint of raw, fresh cream per quart of the
preparation.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2759—The Making of Fruit Ice Preparations"><a id="rcp.2759"
 >2759—THE MAKING OF FRUIT ICE PREPARATIONS</a></h3>

<p>These preparations are made in two ways as <span class="nw">follows:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Rub the fruit through a fine sieve, after having pounded it
if its nature admit of it. Dilute the purée with an equal quantity of
cold sugar syrup at 32° (saccharom.), and add lemon juice in a
quantity subject to the acidity of the treated fruit.</p>

<p>This mixture of ingredients should always be cold, and should
be tested with saccharom (pèse-sirops). If the instrument marks more
than the proper degree, dilute the preparation with a little water; if it
mark less, add syrup until the required degree is reached.</p>

<p>(2) Pound the fruit with an average quantity of ten oz. of sugar
per lb.; but remember that this proportion may be modified either
way, subject to the sweetness of the fruit used.</p>

<p>Rub the whole through a sieve; and then, to obtain the proper
degree of strength, add the necessary quantity of filtered water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2760—Liqueur-ice Preparations"><a id="rcp.2760"
 >2760—LIQUEUR-ICE PREPARATIONS</a></h3>

<p>These preparations are made by adding to the syrup or the
cream which forms the base of the ice a given quantity of the
selected liqueur, the latter being generally added when the
preparation is cold.</p>

<p>The proportion of one-fifth pint of liqueur per quart of syrup may
be taken as an average. Subject to the requirements this liqueur
<a id="png.811" href="#png.811"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>793<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>flavour may be intensified with strong tea for rum ices; with
orange-rind for Curaçao-flavoured ices, with fresh, crushed cherry-stones
for Kirsch ices, etc.</p>

<p>These preparations should always contain some lemon-juice,
and their strength should reach the average degree indicated for
fruit ices.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2816—Light Ices"><a id="rcp.2816"
 >2816—LIGHT ICES</a></h3>

<p>These ices differ from those dealt with above, in that they are
moulded and frozen directly, without a sojourn in the freezer.</p>

<p>To this class belong the ices most commonly served and the
best; and, since their preparation requires no special utensils, they
may be served everywhere: such are the “Iced Biscuits,” the
“Bombes,” the “<a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a>,” the “Parfaits,” the “Puddings,” and the
“Iced Soufflés.”</p>

<p>These different kinds of ices greatly resemble one another,
and their names, which are puzzling at times, are only a matter of
fancy.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2817—Various Preparations"><a id="rcp.2817"
 >2817—VARIOUS PREPARATIONS</a></h3>

<p>The old iced-biscuit preparation consisted of an English
custard, prepared from one lb. of sugar, twelve egg-yolks, and one
pint of milk.</p>

<p>When the custard was cooked, it used to be strained into a
basin, left to cool (being fanned the while), and then placed upon
ice, and finished with the whisk. Originally this cream was moulded
at this stage; but now it is customary to add one quart of whipped
cream to it; which operation renders the recipe more like that of
a Bombe, which, in its turn, resembles that of the preparation for
<i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousses</a></i>.</p>

one lb. of powdered sugar, until the paste gets very firm and reaches
the <a href="#g_ribbon"><i>ribbon</i></a>-stage.</p>

<p>Take the basin off the fire, and whisk until the whole is quite
cold. Then, add eight oz. of <a href="#rcp.2383">Italian <i>meringue</i></a> and one pint of
whisked cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2819—The Moulding of Iced Biscuits"><a id="rcp.2819"
 >2819—THE MOULDING OF ICED BISCUITS</a></h3>

<p>These biscuits are moulded in rectangular brick-shaped cases,
fitted with lids, top and bottom.</p>

<p>Generally, the preparation moulded in the covers is of a
different flavour and colour from the one filling the middle of the
mould.</p>

<p>For example, one of the covers may be garnished with strawberry,
and the other with violet preparation, while the central portion
may hold a vanilla-flavoured preparation. After having frozen
them for three hours, in a pail filled with freezing ice, and turned
them out, these bricks are cut up vertically into rectangles, on
the cut sides of which the differently coloured layers are distinctly
marked. Place these rectangles in special paper cases; decorate
them on top, if the directions admit of it, and place them in a
refrigerator until about to serve.</p>

<p>Nearly all Bombe preparations may become the base of biscuits,
which are then named after them; <i>e.g.</i>: from Bombe Odessa,
Odessa Iced Biscuits may be prepared.</p>

<h3 class="recipe" title="2826—Bombes (Generic Recipe)"><a id="rcp.2826"
 >2826—BOMBES (Generic Recipe)</a></h3>

<p>Originally, Bombes were made from an ordinary ice preparation,
in spherical moulds; hence their name, which is once more justified
by their arrangement, consisting as it used to do of superposed
and concentric layers, the outermost of which was very thin. Nowadays,
Bombes are more often moulded in the shape of shells, but
the preparation from which they are made is much more delicate
than it was formerly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2827—Preparation for Bombes"><a id="rcp.2827"
 >2827—PREPARATION FOR BOMBES</a></h3>

<p>Gradually mix thirty-two egg-yolks with one quart of syrup at
28°. Put the whole on a very moderate fire, whisking it as for
a <i><a href="#g_genoise">Génoise</a></i>, and, when the preparation is firm enough and taken off
the fire, continue whisking it over ice until it is quite cold. Then
add the selected flavour, and one and one-third quarts of stiffly-whipped
cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2828—The Moulding of Bombes"><a id="rcp.2828"
 >2828—THE MOULDING OF BOMBES</a></h3>

<p>First <i><a href="#g_clothe">clothe</a></i> the bottom and sides of a mould with the ice
preparation denoted by the name of the Bombe. This coat, which
should vary in thickness in accordance with the size of the mould,
should be somewhat thin, and made from an ordinary ice preparation,
which is suited better than any other kind to this class
of dish.</p>

<p>The middle is then filled with a Bombe preparation, flavoured
as directed, or with a <i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i> preparation. The whole is then
covered with a round piece of white paper, and the mould is
hermetically sealed with its cover, set to freeze, and left for two or
three hours in the ice.</p>

<p>When about to serve, take the mould out of the ice; wash
it with cold water; dip it quickly in tepid water; dry it with
a towel, and overturn the mould on a napkin or on a block of
ice.</p>

<p>The composition for <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> is prepared either from English
cream or from syrup. The last method is specially suited to fruit
<i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2915—Preparation for Iced Fruit Mousses"><a id="rcp.2915"
 >2915—PREPARATION FOR ICED FRUIT MOUSSES</a></h3>

<p>This is a cold syrup at 35°, to which is added an equal quantity
of a purée of the fruit under treatment, and twice that amount of
very stiff Chantilly cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2916—Preparation of Iced Mousse with Cream"><a id="rcp.2916"
 >2916—PREPARATION OF ICED MOUSSE WITH CREAM</a></h3>

<p>Make an English cream from one lb. of powdered sugar, sixteen
egg-yolks, and one pint of milk, and leave it to cool.</p>

<p>When it is quite cold, add to it one pint of raw cream,
two-thirds oz. of powdered tragacanth gum, and the flavour which
is to characterise the preparation.</p>

<p>If the <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousse</a></i> be a fruit one, add to it one pint of a purée of
fresh fruit.</p>

<p>Whisk over ice, until the preparation gets very frothy; put it into
moulds, lined with white paper; thoroughly close them, and keep
them in a refrigerator for two or three hours, subject to their size.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2917—Various Iced Mousses"><a id="rcp.2917"
 >2917—VARIOUS ICED MOUSSES</a></h3>

<p>After the same procedure, <i><a href="#g_mousse">mousses</a></i> may be prepared with
Anisette, Coffee, Chocolate, Kirsch, Maraschino, Rum, Tea, etc.;
Apricots, Strawberries, Oranges and Tangerines, fresh Walnuts,
Peaches, Vanilla, Violets, etc.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2918—Parfait (Generic Recipe)"><a id="rcp.2918"
 >2918—PARFAIT (Generic Recipe)</a></h3>

<p>Mix thirty egg-yolks with one quart of cold syrup at 28°. Put
the mixture on a slow fire, and cook it as for an English cream;
strain it, and whisk it on ice until it is quite cold.</p>

<p>Add three pints of very stiff, whisked cream and one-fifth pint
<a id="png.829" href="#png.829"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>of brandy or rum, in order to finish it; mould the preparation in
Parfait moulds, and pack them in a freezer for from two to three
hours.</p>

<p>N.B.—The term “Parfait,” which, formerly, was applied only to
“Parfait au Café,” has become the common name for un-<i><a href="#g_clothe">clothed</a></i>
ices, made from Bombe-preparations having but one flavour. And
this is fairly logical, seeing that Bombe-preparations, but for a
few insignificant distinctions, are exactly like Parfait-preparation.</p>

<p>It is therefore just as reasonable to make vanilla, chocolate, and
<a href="#g_pralined"><i>pralined</i></a> Parfaits, etc., as to make them with coffee.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2919—Iced Puddings"><a id="rcp.2919"
 >2919—ICED PUDDINGS</a></h3>

<p>Preparations of this class follow no hard and fast rules, and, in
reality, they are not ices at all. They are nothing else than iced
entremets, the bases of which generally consist of thick English
custard, the same as that which serves in the preparation of
Bavarois.</p>

<p>The few following recipes, however, are exceptions to this
rule.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2920—Pudding de Castries"><a id="rcp.2920"
 >2920—PUDDING DE CASTRIES</a></h3>

<p><i><a href="#g_clothe">Clothe</a></i> a Bombe mould with a thin layer of vanilla ice-cream,
and fill it with two Bombe-preparations, spread in somewhat thick,
alternate layers. One of the preparations should be of vanilla, on
each thickness of which a layer of lady’s-finger biscuits, cut into
dice and sprinkled with Anisette, should be spread; and the
other preparation should be of tangerine.</p>

<p>Between the layers, sprinkle a few pinches of grated chocolate,
and fill up the mould with a thickness of vanilla ice-cream.</p>

<p>Thoroughly close the utensil; pack it for about two or three
hours. Turn it out on a folded napkin; sprinkle thereon a few
red, crushed <a href="#g_pralin"><i>pralins</i></a>; and serve an iced tangerine syrup separately.</p>

<p>The preparation differs according as to whether the <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflés</a></i> be
prepared with fruit, or with such flavours as Vanilla, Coffee,
Chocolate, etc.</p>

<p>The last named are made with the Iced-<i><a href="#g_mousse">Mousse</a></i> preparation
(No. <a href="#rcp.2916">2916</a>), which may also serve for the fruit <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflés</a></i>; but, in the
case of the latter, the following preparation is <span class="nw">preferable:—</span></p>

<p>Whisk the whites of ten eggs to a very stiff froth, and add
to this one and one-tenth lbs. of sugar cooked to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a></i>
stage. Transfer the whole to a basin; flavour according to fancy,
and add one pint of a purée of fruit and one pint of very stiffly-whisked
cream.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2925—The Moulding of Large and Small Iced Soufflés"><a id="rcp.2925"
 >2925—THE MOULDING OF LARGE AND SMALL ICED SOUFFLÉS</a></h3>

<p>Mould the large ones in ordinary <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflé</a></i> timbales, which
should be lined with bands of white paper, fixed with butter,
and overreaching the edges of the timbales by one and a half
to two inches, that the preparation, in projecting above the
brims of the utensils, may appear like a <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflé</a></i> when the paper
is removed.</p>

<p>The small <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflés</a></i> are moulded in cases or in small silver
<i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i>, which are likewise wrapped in bands of paper, that the
preparation may rise above their brims. As soon as they are
moulded, put the <i><a href="#g_souffle">Soufflés</a></i> in a very cold refrigerator; and when
about to serve them, carefully remove the bands of paper which,
once the preparation has solidified, have served their purpose; and
<a id="png.831" href="#png.831"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>813<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dish the cases or silver <i><a href="#g_cassolette">cassolettes</a></i> on a napkin or on a carved
block of ice.</p>

<p>Like the Bombes, and the Iced Biscuits, Iced <i>Soufflés</i><!-- TN: acute invisible --> may be
indefinitely varied, owing to the multitudinous combinations to
which they lend themselves.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2926—Sorbets (Sherbets)"><a id="rcp.2926"
 >2926—SORBETS (Sherbets)</a></h3>

<p>Sherbets and their derivative preparations consist of very light
and barely-congealed ices, served after the Entrées. They serve in
freshening the stomach; preparing it to properly receive the
roast.</p>

<p>They are at once appetisers and helps to digestion.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2927—Preparation for Sorbets"><a id="rcp.2927"
 >2927—PREPARATION FOR SORBETS</a></h3>

<p>Sherbets are made from any liqueur ice preparation at 15°; or
they may be prepared as <span class="nw">follows:—</span>For one quart of preparation, take
the juice of two lemons and one orange, half-a-pint of port wine, of
Samos wine, of Sauterne, or other good wine; and add cold
syrup at 22°, until the saccharometer registers 15°.</p>

<p>For liqueur sherbets, allow about one-fifth pint of liqueur per
quart of the preparation; but remember that this is subject to the
kind of liqueur used. For the quantity just prescribed, use syrup at
18° or 19°, which the subsequent addition of liqueur reduces to the
proper degree. Whatever be the kind of liqueur, the latter should
only be added when the Sherbet is completely frozen; that is to say
at the last moment.</p>

<p>Fruit Sorbets are generally prepared from the juices and syrups
of aqueous fruits. Fruit purées are scarcely suited to this mode of
procedure, and they are only resorted to in exceptional cases.</p>

<p><i>The Freezing of Sherbets.</i>—Pour the preparation into the turbine
or the freezer, which should have been previously packed, and keep
the utensil on the move. Remove portions of the preparation from
the sides of the receptacle as fast as they adhere thereto, and mix
them with the whole, until the latter is completely congealed; remembering
not to stir at all during the freezing process. When the
preparation is firm enough, mix with it, gently, the quarter of its
weight of <a href="#rcp.2383">Italian <i>meringue</i></a> or very stiffly whipped cream; and finish
by the addition of the liqueur.</p>

<p><i>The Dishing of Sherbets.</i>—Take some of the Sherbet preparation
in a spoon, and set it in Sherbet or Sherry glasses, shaping it
to a point.</p>

<p>When the Sherbet is prepared with wine, sprinkle the preparation
when it is in the glasses with a tablespoonful of the
selected wine.</p>

<p><a id="png.832" href="#png.832"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>814<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The consistence of a Sherbet, of what kind soever, should be
such as to allow of its being drunk.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2928—Various Sorbets"><a id="rcp.2928"
 >2928—VARIOUS SORBETS</a></h3>

<p>Having pointed out that Sherbets may be prepared from the
juices of every fruit such as Pine-apple, Cherries, Strawberries,
Raspberries, Red-currants, etc., and from every wine and liqueur
such as Port, Samos wine, Marsala, Johannisberg<!-- TN: original reads "Johannisburg" -->, Rum, Kirsch,
Liqueur-Brandy, etc., and since the procedure is the same in every
case, there is no need to devote a special article to each.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2929—Sorbet à la Sicilienne"><a id="rcp.2929"
 >2929—SORBET <span class="nw">A LA SICILIENNE</span></a></h3>

<p>Keep a very green water melon in the refrigerator for three
hours.</p>

<p>One hour before serving, open it on top, as directed under
“Surprise Melon,” and withdraw the seeds.</p>

<p>Then, detach the pulp by means of a silver spoon, without
withdrawing it from the fruit; sprinkle it with Maraschino, and
put the whole back into the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Dish on fragmented ice or on a block of the latter, and serve the
pulp before the diners in Sherbet glasses.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2930—Granités"><a id="rcp.2930"
 >2930—GRANITÉS</a></h3>

<p>Granités answer the same purpose as Sherbets, while they may
also be introduced into certain culinary preparations.</p>

<p>The bases of these preparations consist of very thin syrups
made from fruit juices, and not overreaching fourteen degrees
(saccharometer).</p>

<p>Granités consist only of iced syrups, and are not combined with
any Italian or other <i><a href="#g_meringue">meringue</a></i>.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Sherbets, but more particularly in regard
to these, the operator should remember not to stir the syrup during
the freezing process, lest it turn; and, when it is congealed, it
should form a light, granulated mass.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2931—Marquises"><a id="rcp.2931"
 >2931—MARQUISES</a></h3>

<p>Marquises are generally made from strawberries or pine-apple,
with Kirsch. The preparation is that of a Sherbet with Kirsch,
registering 17° by the saccharometer. The freezing is done as for
Granités; but it should be carried a little further.</p>

<p>When about to serve, mix the preparation per pint thereof
with half a pint of very stiff Chantilly cream, combined with a
strawberry or pine-apple purée, subject to the designation of the
Marquise.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2932—Punch à la Romaine"><a id="png.833" href="#png.833"><span class="pagenum"><span

 ></span></span></a><a id="rcp.2932"
 >2932—PUNCH <span class="nw">A LA ROMAINE</span></a></h3>

<p>Mix sufficient dry white wine, or dry champagne, with one pint
of syrup at 22°, to reduce the latter to 17°; add the juice of two
oranges and two lemons, a strip of orange and lemon <i><a href="#g_zest">zest</a></i>, and let
infusion proceed for one hour.</p>

<p>Strain the syrup and bring it to 18°.</p>

<p>Freeze in the freezer, until it is somewhat stiff, and mix it with
the quarter of its volume of <a href="#rcp.2383">Italian <i>meringue</i></a> (prepared from two
egg-whites and three and a half oz. of sugar).</p>

<p>When about to serve, complete with one-fifth pint of Rum, added
little by little.</p>

<p>Serve the preparation in glasses, after the style of the Sherbets.</p>

<p>N.B.—For all Sherbets and Punches, one quart of the finished
preparation should be allowed for every ten people.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2933—Spooms"><a id="rcp.2933"
 >2933—SPOOMS</a></h3>

<p>Spoom is a kind of Sherbet prepared from a syrup at 20°. Add
to it twice as much <a href="#rcp.2383">Italian <i>meringue</i></a> as was added to the Sherbets.
Do not work it too briskly, that it may remain very light and frothy.</p>

<p>Spooms are made from fruit juices; but more often from such
wines as Champagne, Samos, Muscat, Zucco, etc.</p>

<p>Serve it in glasses like the Sherbets.</p>

<p>Work eight oz. of powdered sugar with eight egg-yolks in a
saucepan, until the whole becomes white and reaches the <a href="#g_ribbon"><i>ribbon</i></a>
stage. Then add consecutively: one-fifth pint of capillary syrup,
one pint of freshly made, boiling hot tea, and the same amount of
boiling milk; whisking briskly the while, that the drink may be very
frothy. Complete at the last moment with one-third pint of the
liqueur which is to characterise the Bavaroise, <i>i.e.</i>, either Kirsch or
Rum.</p>

<p>If the Bavaroise be flavoured with vanilla, orange or lemon, let
the flavour infuse in the milk for fifteen minutes beforehand. If it
be flavoured with chocolate, dissolve six oz. of the latter, and add
the milk to it, flavoured with vanilla.</p>

<p>If it be coffee-flavoured, set three oz. of freshly-torrified and <i><a href="#g_concass">concassed</a></i>
coffee to infuse in the milk or flavour with one pint of freshly-made
coffee.</p>

<p>Bavaroise is served in special glasses, and it must be frothy.</p>

<p>Peel and slice one-half lb. of peaches and an equal quantity of
pineapple; add four oz. of ripe, melon pulp, cut into dice, and
four oz. of a mixture of raspberries and red and white currants,
cleared of their stalks. Put these fruits in a silver timbale and
keep the latter on ice. Set a little cinnamon to infuse in a half-bottleful

<h3 class="recipe" title="2952—Plain Stewed Fruit"><a id="rcp.2952"
 >2952—PLAIN STEWED FRUIT</a></h3>

<p>Fruit for stewing is used whole, halved or quartered, and cooked
or poached in a syrup, of a flavour in keeping with the fruit.</p>

<p>Dish these preparations in tazzas, bowls or deep dishes; cover
them with their syrup, reduced or not; and, in certain cases, thicken
the latter with arrowroot. They may be served hot or cold; but
in any case, the fruit used should not be too ripe.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2953—Mixed Stewed Fruit"><a id="rcp.2953"
 >2953—MIXED STEWED FRUIT</a></h3>

<p>These preparations generally consist of stewed, fresh fruit of one
or several kinds; combined with fruit purées.</p>

<p>Quince and apple jellies are greatly used, either in coating the
preparations or in bordering them with dice, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With this class of stewed fruits, which are merely a matter of
fancy and taste, candied and preserved fruits are almost always
used as auxiliary constituents.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2954—Jams"><a id="rcp.2954"
 >2954—JAMS</a></h3>

<p>Under this generic title the following preparations are
<span class="nw">classed:—</span></p>

<p>(1) Those in which the fruit is treated directly with the
<span class="nw">sugar:—</span></p>

<p>(2) Those in which the juice alone, owing to its gelatinous
nature, produces, together with the sugar, consistent jellies.</p>

<p>The amount of sugar used is subject to the nature of the fruit
and its sweetness; but in the case of nearly all tart fruits, the
weight of sugar should equal that of the fruit, or nearly so.</p>

<p>If too much sugar be used, the flavour is impaired; while crystallisation
will follow very shortly afterwards; if too little be used, the
jam has to be overcooked in order to be made sufficiently consistent,
and the flavour is once more impaired by protracted evaporation;
finally if the time allowed for cooking be inadequate, rapid
fermentation will be the result.</p>

<p><a id="png.839" href="#png.839"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>821<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In making jam, therefore, the operator should base his measure
of sugar upon the nature of the fruit he intends treating.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2955—The Cooking, Potting, and Sealing of Jams"><a id="rcp.2955"
 >2955—THE COOKING, POTTING, AND SEALING OF JAMS</a></h3>

<p>The time allowed for cooking any jam whatsoever can only be
approximately decided, and it is a gross mistake to suppose the
case otherwise, since the matter is wholly dependent upon the intensity
of the fire, and the resulting speed of the evaporation of the
vegetable moisture. Theoretically, a jam is all the better for
having been cooked quickly, seeing that it may thus more easily
preserve its colour and flavour.</p>

<p>For all that, unless great care and attention be exercised, a whole-fruit
jam ought not to be made on a too violent fire, lest it burn.
Conversely, when jellies are in question, wherein the juice alone of
the fruit is treated, the fire should be as intense as possible; in
order that the required degree of consistence, which marks the close
of the operation, may be reached as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>The degree of consistence is the same for all jellies, and may be
ascertained thus: when the steam given off by the preparation
loses its density, and the boiling movement becomes perceptible, it
may be concluded that evaporation has ceased, and that the real
cooking-process, which is very rapid, has begun. At this stage
frequently take the skimmer out of the saucepan.</p>

<p>The jam adhering to it falls off, at first very quickly; then, in
a few minutes, it is seen to accumulate towards the centre of the
skimmer and to fall therefrom slowly at lengthy intervals, in large
drops.</p>

<p id="g_nappe">This stage, which is indubitably indicative of the cooking being
at an end, is called the “<i>nappe</i>” and is equivalent to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">large-thread</a>
stage</i> in the cooking of sugar; and, as soon as it is reached
the jam should be taken off the fire. Allow it to cool for seven or
eight minutes, and pour it into pots, which, if of glass, should be
gradually heated, lest they crack.</p>

<p>The following day, set a round piece of white paper saturated
with rectified glycerine, on each pot, and drop these pieces of
paper directly upon the jam. Rectified glycerine will be found
preferable by far to the commonly-used sugared brandy.</p>

<p>Then close the pots with a double sheet of paper, fastened on
with string, and place them somewhere in the dry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2956—Apricot Jam"><a id="rcp.2956"
 >2956—APRICOT JAM</a></h3>

<p>Cut the apricots in two, and use very ripe fruit, grown in the
open, if possible. Break the stones, skin the almonds, and cut
them in two. Allow three-quarters lb. of loaf-sugar per lb. of fruit.
Put this sugar in a preserving pan with one-third pint of water per
<a id="png.840" href="#png.840"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>822<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>two lbs. of sugar, and, when the latter is dissolved, boil for a few
minutes, carefully skimming the while. Add the apricots, set the
whole to cook on a moderate fire, and stir incessantly, especially
towards the end, when the jam is more particularly prone to burn
on the bottom of the saucepan. Take the jam off the fire as soon
as it reaches the “<i><a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a></i>” stage, as explained above, and mix the
almonds with the jam.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2957—Cherry Jam"><a id="rcp.2957"
 >2957—CHERRY JAM</a></h3>

<p>Stone the cherries, and allow one and a half lbs. of loaf-sugar
per two lbs. of the fruit; taking care to have equal weights of sugar
and fruit if the latter be not over sweet. Put the sugar in the
preserving pan; moisten it with water that it may dissolve, and
boil it for five minutes, skimming carefully the while. Add the
cherries and a half-pint of red-currant juice, and cook over a fierce
fire until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is reached.</p>

<p><span class="nw"><i>Remarks</i>:—</span>(1) The addition of red-currant juice is advocated
for this jam, seeing that by ensuring the proper consistence it
obviates prolonged cooking; and, as I have already pointed out,
red fruit is all the better, and preserves a more perfect colour, when
it is cooked rapidly.</p>

<p>(2) When the fruit begins to boil, carefully skim it, otherwise
the scum hardens, and not only spoils the jam but often sets it
fermenting.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2958—Strawberry Jam"><a id="rcp.2958"
 >2958—STRAWBERRY JAM</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the most difficult jams to make. There are
several ways of preparing it, and the one I give strikes me as the
quickest and simplest. Clean the fruit, which should be just ripe.
Only wash it when absolutely necessary, as, for instance, when
mould has stuck to it.</p>

<p>Allow twelve oz. of sugar per lb. of fruit. Put this sugar in a
preserving pan, sprinkle it with water that it may dissolve, and
cook it to the <i>large-ball stage</i> (see No. <a href="#rcp.2344">2344</a>), taking care to skim
thoroughly when boiling begins. Throw the strawberries into the
sugar, and set the preserving pan on the side of the fire for seven
or eight minutes; that is to say, until the moisture of the fruit has
dissolved the sugar to a syrup.</p>

<p>Return the saucepan to a fierce fire, and cook the strawberries
for ten or twelve minutes, remembering to carefully remove the
scum that forms.</p>

<p>Then withdraw the strawberries by means of a slice and drain
them in a basin. Continue cooking the syrup rapidly, until the
<i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> shows signs of appearing, then return the
<a id="png.841" href="#png.841"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>823<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>strawberries for five minutes; that is to say, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is
completely reached.</p>

<p>Fill the pots, little by little, that the strawberries may be well
distributed in them and not rise in a mass to the top, as often
happens when the receptacles are filled too quickly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2959—Orange Marmalade"><a id="rcp.2959"
 >2959—ORANGE MARMALADE</a></h3>

<p>Select some oranges about equal in size, of a good colour, free
from blemishes, and with thick and soft rinds. The latter consideration
is important, seeing that the parboiling operation is
effected more perfectly when the rinds are thick and supple.</p>

<p>Prick them somewhat deeply with a small, pointed stick (in
order to precipitate the cooking process), and throw them into
a preserving pan of boiling water. Boil for thirty minutes; drain
the oranges, cool them, and put them under a running tap for
twelve hours, or more if possible; or soak them in constantly
changed, cold water for twenty hours. The object of this operation
is to soften the rinds and extract their bitterness.</p>

<p>This done, drain the oranges; quarter them, remove their pips
and filaments, and rub them through a coarse sieve.</p>

<p>Take the same weight of sugar as of orange purée. Melt the
former in the preserving pan, and boil it for five or six minutes,
skimming carefully the while. Then add the orange purée, and
one-quarter pint of good apple juice per lb. of the former.</p>

<p>During the first stage of the cooking process, skim with great
care, and during the second stage, stir almost incessantly until the
<i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is reached.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2960—Plum Jam"><a id="rcp.2960"
 >2960—PLUM JAM</a></h3>

<p>Allow twelve oz. of loaf-sugar per lb. of stoned plums.</p>

<p>Dissolve the sugar; skim, set it to boil for seven or eight
minutes, and proceed for the cooking as directed under apricot jam.</p>

<p><span class="nw"><i>Remarks</i>:—</span>(1) It is a mistake to let the plums macerate in the
sugar for some hours previously, for the acid they contain causes
them to blacken, and the colour of the jam is thus spoiled. (2) In
order to have greengage jam of a fine, green colour, do not cook
more than from six to eight lbs. of it at a time, and cook that
quantity as quickly as possible.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2961—Rhubarb Jam"><a id="rcp.2961"
 >2961—RHUBARB JAM</a></h3>

<p>Rhubarb jam is one of the most difficult and tedious to make
owing (1) to the abundant moisture contained by the vegetable;
(2) to its proneness to burn on the bottom of the saucepan,
especially towards the close of the cooking process.</p>

<p>If it be desired very green, select suitable natural rhubarb; if it
be desired pink, only take the central stalks which are bordered
<a id="png.842" href="#png.842"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>824<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with red, or use forced rhubarb. In any case, it is best not to make
more than five or six lbs. at once.</p>

<p>Suppress the ends of the stalks, cut what remains into pieces;
by means of a small knife, scrape off the adhering skin and cut the
stalks into three-inch lengths. Allow thirteen oz. of loaf-sugar per lb.
of rhubarb. Dissolve the former, boil it for seven or eight minutes
and then throw the rhubarb into it. Cover the preserving pan and,
put it on the side of the stove for about twelve minutes that the
fibres of the rhubarb may be disaggregated, and at the end of that
time become like vermicelli.</p>

<p>Then set the saucepan upon a fierce fire, and stir constantly
until the preparation reaches the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i>, whereupon the jam
is finished.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2962—Tomato Jam"><a id="rcp.2962"
 >2962—TOMATO JAM</a></h3>

<p>There are also several ways of making this jam, of which the
following seems the most expeditious:</p>

<p>The first fact that should be grasped is that the amount of pulp
that can be used represents about one-fifth of the tomato, and this
itself depends upon the kind of tomato used, and whether it be
just ripe, nearly so, or very ripe.</p>

<p>In order to obtain one lb. of pulp, therefore, five lbs. of tomatoes
should be used, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Finely slice the tomatoes, and rub them through a sieve. Put
the juice and the purée into the jam-saucepan, and boil for five
minutes, stirring the while.</p>

<p>This done, pour the whole into a napkin, stretched between the
four legs of an overturned stool, as for straining a jelly; and let it
drain thoroughly.</p>

<p>At the end of the operation, therefore, all that remains on the
napkin is the mere vegetable pulp, freed of all moisture.</p>

<p>Allow the same weight of sugar as of pulp. Put the former
into the jam-saucepan, together with a small glassful of water; let
it dissolve, and cook it to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-ball</a> stage</i> (see the cooking of
sugar); taking care to skim it well as soon as it begins to boil. A
stick of vanilla may be put with the sugar before boiling it; or the
jam may be flavoured with a good tablespoonful of vanilla sugar
when it is taken off the fire; in any case, the jam ought to be
flavoured with vanilla.</p>

<p>When the sugar has reached the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-ball</a> stage</i>, add the
tomato pulp to it, and one-fourth pint of red-currant juice per lb. of pulp. Owing to the fact that tomato pulp of itself has no
cohesive properties the mixing of red-currant juice with it is
essential.</p>

<p><a id="png.843" href="#png.843"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>825<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Set the preserving pan upon a fierce fire, stirring incessantly the
while, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is reached; then let the jam cook
for a few more minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2963—Black-currant Jelly"><a id="rcp.2963"
 >2963—BLACK-CURRANT JELLY</a></h3>

<p>Take some very ripe black-currants: clean them; put them
into the preserving-pan with half a glassful of water per two lbs.
of fruit, and let them boil.</p>

<p>While this preparatory operation is in progress, the skins of the
currants burst, and their juice flows into the pan. At this stage,
transfer the fruit to a sieve lying on a bowl—a much simpler
method than crushing and pressing them in a twisted towel.</p>

<p>Allow as many lbs. of sugar as there are quarts of juice; put
this sugar into the preserving-pan; dissolve it, and cook it to the
<i><a href="#g_sugar">small-ball</a> stage</i>; thoroughly skimming the while. Add the
black-currant juice, combined per quart with half pint of white-currant
juice.</p>

<p>Move the utensil to the side of the stove for a few minutes, that
the sugar may dissolve, and then cook the jelly on a fierce fire,
carefully skimming the while, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is almost
reached.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>: The object of adding the white-currant jelly is to
modify the blackness of pure black-currant jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2964—Quince Jelly"><a id="rcp.2964"
 >2964—QUINCE JELLY</a></h3>

<p>Select very ripe fruit; cut it into slices; peel and pip these, and
throw them into a basin of fresh water.</p>

<p>Then put them into a preserving-pan with three and a half pints
of water per lb. of quinces, and cook them without touching them.
This done, transfer them to a sieve, and let them drain. Return
the juice to the pan, together with twelve oz. of loaf-sugar per lb.;
dissolve the sugar; and set the whole to cook on a fierce fire,
meanwhile skimming with care, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is almost
reached.</p>

<p>As soon as the jelly is cooked, strain it through a piece of
muslin stretched over a basin; and by this means, a perfectly clear
jelly will be obtained.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2965—Red-currant Jelly (Method A)"><a id="rcp.2965"
 >2965—RED-CURRANT JELLY (Method A)</a></h3>

<p>Take some red and white currants, in the proportion of two-thirds
of the former to one-third of the latter, and combine with
them, per two lbs., three oz. of raspberries. Crush the three
products together in a basin, and then press them in small
quantities at a time, in a strong towel, in order to extract their
juice. Put the juice in the preserving-pan, together with eight oz.
of loaf-sugar per pint. Thoroughly dissolve the sugar, and set the
<a id="png.844" href="#png.844"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>826<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whole to cook over a very fierce fire; meanwhile skimming carefully—more
particularly at first, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is
reached.</p>

<p>N.B.—The yield of juice from red-currants equals about two-thirds
or three-fourths the weight of the raw fruit.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2966—Red-currant Jelly (Method B)"><a id="rcp.2966"
 >2966—RED-CURRANT JELLY (Method B)</a></h3>

<p>Take the same quantities of white and red currants, and of
raspberries, as above. Carefully clean the fruit; wash it in cold
water, and put it into the preserving-pan, with one wineglassful of
water per lb.</p>

<p>Cook the whole gently on the side of the stove for ten or
twelve minutes; transfer the fruit to a sieve, lying on a basin, and
let it drain.</p>

<p>Put the juice into the preserving-pan, with twelve oz. of loaf-sugar
per lb., and proceed with the cooking as before.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2967—Red-currant Jelly (Method C)"><a id="rcp.2967"
 >2967—RED-CURRANT JELLY (Method C)</a></h3>

<p>Take the same quantities as above of white-currants, red-currants,
and raspberries. Remove the currants from their stalks
by means of a fork, and collect them in a basin; clean the
raspberries, and allow twelve oz. of loaf-sugar per lb. of the
fruit.</p>

<p>Dissolve the sugar in the preserving-pan with a little water
and cook it to the <i><a href="#g_sugar">small-ball</a> stage</i>; meanwhile skimming carefully.</p>

<p>Throw the currants and the raspberries into it; put the pan on
the side of the fire for seven or eight minutes, that the juice may
exude from the fruit; and then cook on a fierce fire, skimming
very carefully the while, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is reached.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2968—White-currant Jelly"><a id="rcp.2968"
 >2968—WHITE-CURRANT JELLY</a></h3>

<p>This is made from fresh, very ripe white-currants and two oz.<!-- TN: period invisible -->
of raspberries per lb. of the latter. Any one of the three methods
given above may be followed in its preparation, although Method C
will be found to yield the clearest jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2969—Red-currant Jelly, Prepared Cold"><a id="rcp.2969"
 >2969—RED-CURRANT JELLY, PREPARED COLD</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the juice as directed under No. <a href="#rcp.2965">2965</a>. Add to it
one lb. of icing-sugar per quart, and keep the whole in the cool for
two or three hours, taking care to stir it frequently with a silver
spoon in order to dissolve the sugar. Fill the pots and keep them
uncovered for two or three days.</p>

<p>This done, cover them in the usual way, and set them in the
sun for two or three hours per day for two days.</p>

<p><a id="png.845" href="#png.845"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>827<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This jelly is as fragile as it is delicate, and should be kept
in the dry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2970—Orange Jelly"><a id="rcp.2970"
 >2970—ORANGE JELLY</a></h3>

<p>In order to make one quart of orange jelly, take twelve oranges,
each weighing about five oz.; one-third pint of good apple juice,
one lb. of loaf-sugar, and a tablespoonful of grated orange sugar.
The latter is obtained by rubbing the rinds of the oranges with
loaf-sugar, and then grating the sugar so coloured and flavoured
with a hard knife.</p>

<p>If the jelly be desired garnished, insert a fair-sized, candied
orange-rind cut into small strips.</p>

<p><span class="nw"><i>Preparation</i>:—</span>Thoroughly press the oranges and filter the
juice; prepare the apple juice, and set the sugar to dissolve with
a few drops of water.</p>

<p>Add the orange and apple juice to the sugar, and cook the jelly
like the preceding ones. Leave it to cool for ten minutes; mix
with it the orange sugar and the candied rind, and pour it
into pots.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2971—Apple Jelly"><a id="rcp.2971"
 >2971—APPLE JELLY</a></h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as for quince jelly, and strain the apple juice
without pressing the fruit. Do not cook the latter over much, lest
the juice becomes mixed with pulp. Nevertheless, this should be
very carefully poured away; for, in spite of the greatest care,
there is always a certain amount of deposit.</p>

<p>Put the juice into the preserving pan, with thirteen oz. of loaf-sugar
and one-third of a stick of vanilla per quart.</p>

<p>Cook, and strain through muslin, as in the case of quince jelly.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2972—Tomato Jelly (1st Method)"><a id="rcp.2972"
 >2972—TOMATO JELLY (1st Method)</a></h3>

<p>Prepare the tomatoes as directed under No. <a href="#rcp.2962">2962</a>.</p>

<p>Per lb. of drained juice allow one good pint of apple jelly, twenty oz. of sugar, and a large vanilla stick.</p>

<p>Put into the preserving-pan the sugar, the apple jelly, and the
vanilla-flavoured tomato juice, and put the utensil on the side
of the fire for five minutes.</p>

<p>This done, set the whole to cook on a fierce fire, until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>”
stage</i> is reached.</p>


<h3 class="recipe" title="2973—Tomato Jelly (2nd Method)"><a id="rcp.2973"
 >2973—TOMATO JELLY (2nd Method)</a></h3>

<p>Take the same amount of juice as in the preceding case.</p>

<p>Use red-currant jelly instead of apple jelly, and prepare the
former from red and white currants in the proportion of one-third
of the former to two-thirds of the latter. Use the same amount
of vanilla as above. Put the latter into the preserving-pan;
<a id="png.846" href="#png.846"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>828<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dissolve it with a little water; add the vanilla, and cook it to the
<i><a href="#g_sugar">small-crack</a> stage</i>; remembering to skin carefully at the start.</p>

<p>Add the tomato pulp and the red-currant jelly to the cooked
sugar; put the whole on the side of the stove for a moment in
order to reduce the sugar; and then proceed with the cooking on a
very fierce fire until the <i>“<a href="#g_nappe">nappe</a>” stage</i> is reached.</p>

<h2>Transcriber’s Note</h2>

<p>The final three chapters have been renumbered to match the Table of
Contents.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in numbering—or not—of subheadings remain as printed.</p>

<p>Accenting of uppercase words in recipe headings has been regularised
only if both accented and unaccented forms appear in recipe headings in
the original. Where a word that would be accented if lowercase appears
in the original consistently unaccented when uppercased the unaccented
form is retained as printed (eg “A LA” but “à la”).</p>

<p>Recipe numbers have been corrected where the printed number was obviously out of sequence. Some cross-references have been corrected, and a redundant index entry has been removed.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in hyphenation remain as printed.</p>
